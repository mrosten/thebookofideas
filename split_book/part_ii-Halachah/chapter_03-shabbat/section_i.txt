<h4>The Event Horizon of Sunset</h4>
<p>The entry and exit of Shabbat are defined by a boundary of light. A major debate (Rabbenu Tam vs. the first sunset) exists because of the interval between the setting sun and the appearance of the "medium stars." To truly know a medium star, one must perceive the entire set of stars in a clear sky—a statistical observation that places the true end of the day roughly 90 minutes after sunset. While many follow the lenient first sunset for the start of Shabbat to be safe, the exit requires the full weight of the stars to ensure the sanctity of the day is preserved.</p>

<h4>The Sovereignty of the Eruv</h4>
<p>Carrying on Shabbat represents the transfer of an object from the individual domain to the public domain. To the Rambam, the physical dimensions of the space (the "16 amot") are the deciding factor. To Rashi and the Tosafot, it is the social dimension (the number of people). Because the Shulchan Aruch presents both views, a person should strive to be strict, respecting the silence of the public space, yet one may depend on the lenient community standard in times of great necessity.</p>

<strong>The Midnight Watch</strong>
In a place where city lights do not obstruct the view—like a desert—the stars reveal the true rhythm of the universe. The delay of 60 to 90 minutes is not an arbitrary rule; it is the physical time required for the "medium light" of the cosmos to become visible to the human eye once the dominant light of the sun has fully retreated.
