The Guide

III, 33] (The Rambam says in

The Guide

III, 49

that most of the mitzvot called “hukim” are to be a fence against the doctrines

of idolatry.

In volume

III chapter 31, he says that all the mitzvot were given for the following

reasons: to teach us some truth or remove some false opinion, to establish a

proper society, to stop wickedness, to train in good manners, and to warn

against bad habits.

In short, opinions, morals and social conduct.

From

these principles it should be clear what the intent of any specific mitzvah is,

and thus in the opinion of Rabbi Shimon [or Rabbi Yehuda to the Yerushalmi and

Sifri], when it doesn't apply. Now, it is interesting to note that there is no

disagreement in the gemara if in fact the reason for the mitzva not to take a

pledge from a widow is not to have to go back to her house every night to

return it, and thus cause to her a bad reputation. It is just that rabbi Yehuda

says you can't decide to limit the scope of the law because of the reason. So,

as to the fact that it is based on reason and to which reason there is no

disagreement. So, we see that it is not as if there is just God and then the

Law. Rather it is God — Reason, and logic — Law. As the Zohar say, Torah is the

shredding of the higher wisdom. Now, this idea doesn't disagree with the

Kabbalah that gives deeper significance to the laws, for the ideal significance

of the Kabbalah is contained within the logic, i.e., in our case, not to give

her [the divine presence] a bad name [falling into exile] among her neighbors

[the higher worlds].
