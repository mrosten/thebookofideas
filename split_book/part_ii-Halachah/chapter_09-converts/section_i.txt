"A woman needs only to go into the mikvah for the sake of getting married... she automatically becomes Jewish." — The Natural Entry.

<h4>The Essence of Conversion</h4>
<p>The transition into the category of Israel is a process of intent and immersion. According to Rav Asi in the Talmud, a non-Jewish woman who immerses in a Mikvah or a natural body of water for the purpose of marriage to a Jew or for purification is automatically considered Jewish. The act of entering the "Waters of Genesis" with the desire to join the covenantal people effectively resets the spiritual identity, even without a complex formal ceremony.</p>

                <p>The physical act of immersion in a holy vessel of water (Mikvah or Ocean) for the sake of the union or purity is the gate. It is a natural transition that bypasses the need for elaborate social ritual, focusing on the immediate change in the soul's environment.</p>

                <p>To the Rambam, being in the "category of Israel" is tied to the 13 Principles of Faith. One who believes in these principles is deserving of love and inclusion, though actual Jewish status still requires the final act of immersion to complete the soul’s integration into the people.</p>

<h4>The Hierarchy of Identity</h4>
<p>The definition of "who is a Jew" is balanced between ancestry and conviction. Someone who does not believe in God or the Oral and Written Law is not considered Jewish in the eyes of the Rambam, regardless of their parentage. Conversely, Rav Saadia Gaon identifies three core principles — God’s existence, His oneness, and reward and punishment — that can bring even non-Jews into a category shared with Israel. This highlights that the "Song of God" is a frequency one must tune into to truly belong.</p>
