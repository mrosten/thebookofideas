Shulchan Aruch

one who is not married is not

required to wear teffilin. Yet because the Baal Shem Tov in his will did emphasize

saying the Shema exactly as the commandment was meant to be I think one should

try to do so. [The five things mentioned in the will of the Baal Shem Tov were:

a.

Learning books of ethics every day.

b.

Carefulness in keeping Shabbat.

c.

Carefulness in saying the Shema.

d.

Going to the mikvah for with the kabalistic

intentions.

e.

Doing a kindness for someone every day.

To Rav

Yehuda in the name of Shmuel saying the Shema is a rabbinical mitzva. It seems

the authorities hold it is Biblical because of the Gemara in Sucah. However, it

would seem that since Brachot is the main place of the subject we ought to

follow the conclusion of the Gemara there that it is rabbinical.

Grace

after bread is possible to shorten. For the first blessing only the first and

last sentence are required. [As the Sages said if one says “blessed is the

Master of this bread”, he had fulfilled his obligation. However, since a

blessing that starts and ends with a blessed can't be changed from that form,

one must say as I have said.] For the second one needs to mention only the

covenant and the Torah and then the final blessing. For the third one, one

needs to mention only the kingdom of David and the last blessing. The fourth

needs only the three mentions of goodness and the three mentions of abundance.
