Chapter 2 – Prayer

·

One

should not cover his head for prayer, for the reason the Sages give for

covering the head is that people don't stand before a king with their head

uncovered. Nowadays one can't stand before a king or with his head

covered

and it is a sign of disrespect to do so, so all the more so one should not do

so in front of God. In Tractate Soferim [Chapter 14, Halachah 15] (which is the

root for the law of wearing a head cover to the Gra it says ‘One who is not

wearing shoes or whose garments are torn or whose head is not covered is

allowed to lead the congregation in prayer up until the 18 blessings. Some say

only one who is not wearing shoes or whose garments are torn but one whose head

is uncovered is not allowed to. He is not allowed to say the Divine Name...

However, to both opinions he can translate but he can't read the Torah scroll

for the congregation and lead the congregation for the 18 blessings.” Wearing

one at any other time is certainly not required. And that was at the time when

it was a sign of respect to wear one in front of a king. Now it is a sign of

disrespect. [As the Targum Onkulus says they went out of Egypt with uncovered

heads.] However, the Gemara itself does say one shouldn't walk four steps

without one's head covered, so even though the Rambam holds that is only for a

Wise person still this Gemara does imply that it is a good thing for everyone.

One should

endeavor to recite the Shema immediately upon rising, before sunrise, in

accordance with the view of Rabbi Eliezer. The Rambam rules that the halachah

follows the Sages—who permit its recitation until the end of the third hour of

the day—only in a case where one has not managed to say it before sunrise.

Nonetheless, one is obligated to strive to say it at that earlier time

.

At night, one

should wait until the time established by Rabbenu Tam, approximately ninety

minutes after sunset (according to some opinions, seventy-two minutes). This,

however, does not imply that one must don tefillin or recite the Amidah at that

moment; those may be performed until the conclusion of the day

.

In the

teachings of Kabbalah, a greater emphasis is placed upon rising at midnight to

engage in Torah study. In matters where the Kabbalistic tradition and the legal

authorities differ, one should follow the Kabbalistic path. It is told that

when the Baal HaTanya was asked about this, he affirmed that one should indeed

act in accordance with Kabbalah. When the questioner objected, noting that the

Shulchan Aruch HaRav instructs to follow the legal authorities, the Baal

HaTanya replied: “That is what the legal authorities wrote.”
