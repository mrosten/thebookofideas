Gemara in Yevamot 76b says that King Solomon converted the daughter of

Pharaoh

. Tosphot  explains a later question of the Gemara to be

,

how could he have married her since she was a first

generation Egyptian; and answers that he didn't really marry her but “attached

himself to her for love” in the way of love, not in the way of marriage. Rashi

explains that the

Gemara

asks how can the verse call it marriage. And it

answers that he intended it to be in the way of prostitution. The

Maharsha

asks on

Rashi

then why was the

Gemara

forced to say she converted

since it could have been “in the way of prostitution” without it.

I think

Rashi's

reasoning must have been like this: A girlfriend is permitted to a King to all

opinions [the argument of the first authorities only applies to everyone else]

.

The

Gemara in Avoda

Z

ara

36 says that to

the Rabbis opinion, marriage with the seven Canaanite nations is forbidden; and

there was a later rabbinical decree to forbid all idolators.

To Rabbi

Shimon Bar Yochai all idolators are forbidden to live with in the way of

marriage from the Torah [but real

kidushin

isn't applicable] and the

Beit

Din

of

Shem

forbid even to live with them in the way of

prostitution.

It seems

clear to me that Solomon held like Rabbi Yehuda in

Bava Kama

115a since

he depended on the fact that the verse gave a reason why the king shouldn't
