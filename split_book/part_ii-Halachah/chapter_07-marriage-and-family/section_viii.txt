Learning Torah

·

One is

not allowed to learn Torah having in mind to use it for a living. However, it

is proper to learn Torah and to trust in God to provide in a way that he

shouldn't be using the Torah or be receiving charity as both are forbidden.

Rabbi Israel Salanter held that it is allowed to be a rabbi (and to earn money

thereby) so it seems he depended on the

Tashbatz

even though it is

against the Rambam.

The

disagreement between the Rambam and the

Tashbatz

is if one is allowed to

learn Torah and depend on the idea that he will be given charity. The

Tashbatz

permits this. However, one is not allowed to say one verse or one word of Torah

in order to make money. This is forbidden to all opinions, and one that does so

has no portion in the next world. This includes the idea of taking a test in

order to show that one knows some subject in Torah in order to get a

kollel

paycheck.

Women are

not allowed to learn Torah as the

Rambam

,

Rif

,

Rosh

,

Tur

and

Shulchan Aruch

write. The Talmud quotes Rabbi Eliezer the Rabbi of

Rabbi Akiva: “It's better for words of the Torah to be burned than to be given

into the hands of women.”

There is

an obligation of saying the

parsha

[section] of the Torah of each week

twice and the Aramaic translation once. The way to do this is saying the

section of every day once and then the Aramaic during the week. Then on Shabbat
