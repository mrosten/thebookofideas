the law doesn't apply. Thus, the daughter of

Pharaoh

would have been forbidden to him even not in the way of marriage unless he

converted her.

Tosphot

it seems

holds like the

R

abbis. So, she would have been permitted to him without

converting, even as an idolator as long as it wasn't in the way of marriage or

publicly. Then the question of the Gemara begins only after he converted her.

widow since the law of the Torah of not taking the garment of a widow should

logically apply only to a poor widow for the reason given there in the Gemara.

This isn't the Halacha but there are many cases where we depend on Rabbi Shimon

in a case of need in other opinions of his and we say “Rabbi Shimon is great
