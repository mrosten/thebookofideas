Rabbi Meir against the majority opinion it does seem that there is someone to

depend on so I would have to allow it in case of necessity even though in all

probability it may be considered spilling seed in vain to the opinion of the

majority. [As the Gemara says,”Rabbi Meir is great enough to depend on in an

A wife

isn't allowed to leave her husband except in a case where there is violence.

Just not liking him or his not being religious enough or too much

are not valid

reasons. This is like the case which the Rema talks about when the husband was

playing cards and desecrated the Sabbath, etc., and the Rema said the wife has

such a

(a forced divorce) which is invalid. It may be

Marriage

(kiddushin) is with two witnesses. However, according to the Ran [Rabbanu

bringing into the wife into the husband’s living quarters, which needs no

witnesses according to the Beit Shmuel in Shulchan Aruch. Ten people are

necessary only for the seven-blessings. Sex is allowed without the blessings.

to get married in a Kosher way without witnesses one needs to do the Kidushin

in writing and then to bring the bride into the husbands domain.

and stays there forever [unless he goes to the grave of Rabbi Nachman and says

there the ten psalms]. The girl that does that to a boy gets the same sin.
