If you

look at either, they become a particle and the argument is clear and one is

right and the other wrong but if you don't look, and totally ignore it they

become waves that reinforce each other in certain things and destructively

interfere in others. For instance, to learn Torah you have to be connected to

the Gra. “No Gra means no Torah”. [Chasidish Torah is just to show that they

learn Torah but it's not Torah.]

Any

connection with chasidim will interfere. To have real prayer, i.e., private

prayer you have to be connected to Rabbi Nachman. Now, in order to solve this

and try to get both flows, this will cause both flows to become particles and

lose their connection to the light. [

Unless both can be fitted into the

vessels of
