<h4>The Mistress vs. The Covenant</h4>
<p>The Halachic structure of relationship covers a wider range than modern religious social norms often admit. According to the majority of early authorities (Ramban, Raavad, Rosh), a stable, non-promiscuous relationship (a "girlfriend" or "mistress") is permitted without the formal status of legal Kiddushin. While Kabbalah suggests it is better to be married—as a mistress sits on the level of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil where the "shells" (klipot) can more easily take hold—the legal framework acknowledges the human need for connection outside the formal bounds of the contract.</p>

                <p>Permitted by the majority of first authorities. It avoids the legal complexities of divorce (get) and allows for a stable union based on mutual consent without the formal "purchase" or covenant of Kiddushin. However, it is more prone to the "klipot" of casual sensory attachment.</p>

                <p>A formal Kiddushin creates a permanent spiritual bond between husband and wife, recognized in the Upper Worlds. It provides a more protected "vessel" for the Divine Light, though it requires a formal, legal exit strategy (Get) should the union fail.</p>

<h4>The Ethics of the Seed</h4>
<p>The discussion of birth control revolves around the prohibition of "spilling seed in vain" versus the positive commandment to be fruitful. While Rabbeinu Tam and the majority opinion are stringent regarding condoms (viewing them as a direct barrier to a natural act), others like Rashi suggest that in cases of health or specific necessity, a temporary barrier or method like the pill is permitted. The fundamental debate is whether the prohibition is a physical act or a failure of the spiritual command to build the world.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>The Secret of Rashi</strong>
If a condom were purely the sin of "spilling seed," why would Rashi permit its use for the "three women" at risk of death? He suggests they simply should not have sex. From this, we infer that the core issue is the Command to Multiply; when that command is suspended by necessity, the physical act becomes a subject of debate between the Great Authorities, with room for individual permit in cases of emergency.
