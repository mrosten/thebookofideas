subsequent generations make similar mistakes. Now, the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah

were so great that God kept trying to convince them of their mistake until they

One of

the objections I have heard against Jesus is that the Sanhedrin of the time

killed him. But, the Talmud says that Herod killed all the Rabbis of the Pharisees

who had

Semichah,

and there was left only one Rabbi, Baba Ben Buta — that

was when Jesus was only a year old or so. So, when Jesus was about thirty, how

command. The

Gemara

in

Succah

holds that we don't put off a

mitzvah of the Torah for a rabbinical decree as it says, “we don't take the

lulav

on the first day of

yom tov

that falls on

Shabbat,
