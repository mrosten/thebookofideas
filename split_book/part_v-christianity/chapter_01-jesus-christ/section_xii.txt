anyway and the wrestling is the vessels of correction trying to contain the

light of chaos until the dawn, i.e., the rising of the light of the name 72.

I think

the real explanation is that  first Yaacob had to fight God [good] and then

evil Esau which is what every person has to go through in order to come to that

level of God — beyond space-time and conception.

For a

person to come what he must come to he first has to fight evil, then he has to

fight God, and then becomes a man. [There is a certain point a person needs to

come to, a critical mass, so to speak, for him to start to wake up.]

This is

represented by the fact that God put the fiery angels before the path to Gan

Eden. For one must go through Hell and Heaven to come to the

Tree of Life

.

The angels try to stop one and then if they don't succeed they use their sword.

God here

also represents Being [the right

sepherah

Kindness], and Esau non-being

[the left

sepherah

, lack of light]. Jacob had to fight both to come to

“Becoming” [the middle

sepherah

,

Yod

He

Vav

He

.]

This is the significance of the wrestling, i.e., the joining of Jacob's level

[right] with Esau's level [left] to come to the middle [Torah].

The

reason Infinite God is sometimes manifested in finite space and time, as with

Jesus, or in the Temple, or in other ways, is to give the finite intelligence

of man some grasp of Him and thus to become attached to Him which is the

purpose of man’s creation. Since there are five levels of man's soul, each manifestation

of God is to give man a grasp of a higher infinity [as the difference between

all the numbers between 0 and 1 and all the numbers between 0 and 2]. As the:

1.

Temple [inanimate]

2.

The Waters: “The spirit of God hovered on the

face of the Waters”.
