Chapter 3 – Jews and

Christians

·

“I

testify that whether a man or woman, slave or maid servant, Jew or

idol-worshiper, the Divine Presence rests on a person only according to his

deeds”

-Tana Deve Eliyahu,

from Eliyahu the prophet. “For it is known

that the souls of Israel are from the earth… but as for the non-Jewish nations

whose souls are from Heaven, they need not perform deeds (613

mitzvot

.)”

-- The Gaon from Vilna (The Gra.) Commentary on

Shir HaShirim,

Chap. 1,

Verse 6.

According

to Rabbi Shneur Zalman (The Baal HaTanya) (in Parshas VaYishlach) the root of

Esav is from worlds higher than Yaakov (Tohu) and that is why Isaac wanted to

bless him, but the mistake of Isaac was in not realizing that Esau had fallen

from that root.

I think

to answer the contradiction between the Gra and the Baal HaTanya that the world

the Kings of Edom in the straight sephirot must somehow have a connection with

the circular ones.

At any

rate I didn't know from where the Gra and the Baal Hatanya got this from until

I saw in

Shaar Ruach HaKodesh: Yichud 10

on the verse, “These are the

three Children of Noah” which basically gives as the root of the children of

Noah the Three Divine Names of 161, 143, and 151. But the support for the Baal

HaTanya’s point of view is the fact that in the same letters are hinted the

name

Elohim

with the

yud

filling the letters. Even though that is

wholly important to note that it is the later permutations of that name which

give rise to the

Klipot,

it seems to me that the root of non-Jews is the

three names, “I Will Be” in the eye of Adam Kamdon, not actually the full names

of 161 ,143, and 151 respectively, for in the full names there are no circular sephirot,

[unless we are referring to the circular sephirot before Adam Kadmon]. But in
