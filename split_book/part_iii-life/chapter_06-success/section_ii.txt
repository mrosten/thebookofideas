[TITLE: The Four Worlds of Activity]
<h4>The Geography of Light</h4>
<p>Success is not only a matter of character, but of placement. Each region of the world operates under a different spiritual frequency, corresponding to the four primary worlds of Kabbalah. These "Lights" can break a person whose vessel is not prepared for them, or elevate one whose root is aligned.</p>

                <h5>Emanation: Pure Revelation</h5>
                <p><strong>Level:</strong> Atzilut (Divine Oneness). The light here is direct and intense. It requires a resilient vessel; without accepted roots, this light causes souls to "break" and become erratic.</p>

                <h5>Creation: The Space of Prayer</h5>
                <p><strong>Level:</strong> Beriah (Meditation & Thought). A space for searching and deep internal construction. It is a world of preparation and mental clarity.</p>
                <span class="status-badge badge-reward">Meditation</span>

                <h5>Formation: The Space of Learning</h5>
                <p><strong>Level:</strong> Yetzirah (Emotions & Study). The realm of logical structure and daily religious learning. It is structured, logical, and increasingly physical.</p>

    document.querySelectorAll('input[name="world-view"]').forEach(radio => {
        radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const views = ['emanation', 'creation', 'formation'];
            views.forEach(v => {
                document.getElementById('view-' + v).style.display = document.getElementById(v + '-view').checked ? 'block' : 'none';

<h4>Self-Search vs. World-Saving</h4>
<p>Saving the world is often a trap that leads to more suffering. True success comes from the <strong>Self-Searchers</strong>—those who seek only to understand and correct their own internal shadows. When you refine your own judgement, the "sparks of holiness" in the world recognize their root in you and attach themselves, elevating the reality around you without the need for forced external change.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>The Mirror of Judgement</strong>
As Epictetus observed: "What disturbs men’s minds is not events, but their judgements on events." Kindness is giving pleasure to another; evil is causing pain for pleasure. Suffering encountered while performing kindness is often merely a weakened form of a judgement that was destined for you in a far harsher way. Kindness serves as a spiritual "lightning rod," absorbing and mitigating the blow.
</div>

<h4>Concentration of Energy</h4>
<p>For deep concentration, the physical body must be aligned with the mental goal. Heavy study is best done with a physical "pile" to move from one side to the other—a visual counter of progress. For lighter insights, a posture that encourages blood flow to the head can assist. Never look down on others, for every person is born into a <em>Tzelem</em> they did not choose; respect is the recognition that God has a heart for every world-line.</p>
