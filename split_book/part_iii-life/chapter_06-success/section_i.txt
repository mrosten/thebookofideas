<h4>The Tzelem of Greatness</h4>
<p>Every person is born with a certain <em>Tzelem</em> (Form)—a unique world-line in time and space that they are destined to grow into. Real success is not about imposing an external order on your life, but about discovering and honoring that internal form. Most people waste years trying to force themselves into a mold that was never meant for them. As Christopher Morley said: "There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your own way."</p>

    document.querySelectorAll('input[name="success-path"]').forEach(radio => {
        radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const isLoser = document.getElementById('loser-traits').checked;
            document.getElementById('view-losers').style.display = isLoser ? 'block' : 'none';

<h4>The Hunger for Perfection</h4>
<p>Success requires an obsession with truth. When Pope Julius II asked Michelangelo when the Sistine Chapel would be done, he replied: "When I shall have done all that I believe required to satisfy art." This is the same spirit that drove the production of <em>Titanic</em>—not a concern for deadlines or cost, but a sacred goal to honor the facts without compromise. Success is the outer light that surrounds a person when they have polished their inner details to match the higher vision.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>Addiction in Conversation</strong>
Watch the particular "loops" in a person's conversation—the ideas or body parts they continuously return to. These are the indicators of where their "Outer Light" is constricted. These hang-ups are the true anchors that prevent a person from achieving their destiny.
