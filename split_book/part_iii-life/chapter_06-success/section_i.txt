Chapter 6 - Success

·

“Beware

of any activity that requires the purchase of new clothes,” [

Thoreau

] because

the clothes reflect the character and if the new activity involves different

clothes, then it's not for you.

Every

person was created with a certain Tzelem {form} {world line in time and space}

that he grows into. Therefore, any attempt to impose an external order on his

life will fail. He can make plans, put in much effort and try with all his

might, but if that order is not a part of his nature, and the nature of his

world-line, it won't be successful.

This is

what Socrates meant by know yourself. Most people waste years of their lives

and sometimes all of it trying to force some type of external order on

themselves that they have been taught is right for them but really isn't.

Christopher Morley said,

'There is only one success -- to be able to spend your life in your own way.

[quoted in the New York Post by Nelson and Dauten].

But even

so, happiness is having worthwhile goals and accomplishing them relative to

this.

This is like Rabbi Nachman's way of learning quickly to gain as many small

points as possible as opposed to learning one part of the subject really well
