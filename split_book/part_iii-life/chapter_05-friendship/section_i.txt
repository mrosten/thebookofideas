<h4>The Test of the Half-Friend</h4>
<p>A true friend is a rarity that can only be identified in the furnace of adversity. As the ancient Arabic parable suggests, a young man may believe he has fifty friends, but his father—with all his years—claims only "one friend and one half-friend." A true friend is the one who, seeing you in a moment of extreme danger or disgrace, immediately pulls you inside, burns the evidence of your shame, and locks the door without requiring a single word of explanation.</p>

<h4>The Flow of Favor</h4>
<p>There is a spiritual "waterfall" to relationships. Someone who has already done you a favor is statistically more likely to do you another than someone you have done a favor for. This is because they have already established a "Giving Flow" toward your level; they occupy a higher spiritual plane in that specific context, and energy flows naturally from High to Low.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>Consistency of Character</strong>
One who has reneged on a promise once will almost certainly do it again. Trust is a vessel that, once broken, requires a radical change in personality to repair. In an ideal world, we would all be "full friends," but in our reality, we must value the small percentages of real connection wherever they manifest.
