[TITLE: The Infinite Light]
<h4>The Mediator Paradox</h4>
<p>There is a deep debate in tradition regarding mediators. The Rambam warns that making any creation a mediator between you and God is a form of idolatry. Yet, we see the Sages visiting the graves of their fathers for help, or seeking the prayers of the righteous when in distress. The resolution lies in the fact that a true Saint is <em>one</em> with the Divine frequency of Emanation. When you attach yourself to a Saint, you are not serving a "creation," but aligning yourself with one of the specified vessels God uses to transmit His service.</p>

        radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const isDavid = document.getElementById('messiah-david').checked;
            document.getElementById('view-david').style.display = isDavid ? 'block' : 'none';

<h4>The Missing Frequency</h4>
<p>Sometimes, even a great Saint or genius lacks certain knowledge because a specific "radio frequency" is missing from their soul’s equipment. This explains how massive historical errors—like the rejection of Jesus by the Saints of his time, or Rabbi Akiva’s misidentification of the Messiah—can occur. One needs both the Davidic and Josephic frequencies; one Sephirah by itself produces no energy. Only when they revolve around each other are useful fruits produced.</p>

<strong>The Universal Path</strong>
The Jewish belief in the power of the Mind (The Father) and the Christian belief in the power of Good Deeds (The Mother Church) together shaped Western civilization. By combining the paths of all the Saints—including the deep insights of Hindu and Buddhist clarity on the oneness of God—we find a correct path where God is accessible to every person, regardless of their specific vessel.

<h4>The Test of the Heart</h4>
<p>Ultimately, the way to tell if a person is a Saint is by the quality of the atmosphere surrounding them. Holiness permeates the area; you feel transformed simply by entering their "Surrounding Light." Whether they are hidden, accelerating toward God at hyperbolic velocities, or visible beacons of tradition, their goal is the same: to reveal that there is nothing besides the Infinite Light.</p>
