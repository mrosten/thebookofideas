is the most powerful thing in the world. It can pierce through great mountains”

— Rabbi Eliezer Shik.

It is an

absolutely essential part of any home to have at least one guest. There are

homeless people in every place. There are always people who need a helping

hand. Letting someone sleep on the couch is important for every home. Yet one

should never overdo his kindness in such a way that makes it hard to keep it

up. Don't be too kind, just a little kind. We see in the Torah that Abraham was

kind to the angels, but Lot went out of his way to beg them to come in and made

a very big deal about it. In such a way one gets worn out quickly. It is better

to do it with

tzimtzum

[control-and limit.]
