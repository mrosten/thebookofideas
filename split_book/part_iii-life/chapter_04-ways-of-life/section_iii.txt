[TITLE: The Scale of Governance]
<h4>The Supreme Individual</h4>
<p>The difference between a free society and a tyranny often rests on a slight philosophical pivot. John Locke placed human rights supreme and government secondary, leading to the foundations of the free West. Rousseau, by contrast, made the "General Will" supreme, providing a blueprint for reigns of terror. In the spiritual realm, your inalienable rights are rooted in the <em>Sephirah</em> of Wisdom, which exists above the relative scale of right and wrong.</p>

<h4>Personality as the Door</h4>
<p>Everything that happens to a person is an expression of their personality. If you see failure, it is a call to correct a fundamental trait. Happiness cannot be found outside of yourself; it must be created within. The door to a better future is the heart, and talking with God in a private place (<em>Hitbodedut</em>) is the key that unlocks that door.</p>

<strong>The Gratitude Foundation</strong>
While many argue whether the Torah is based on faith or deeds, the <em>Duties of the Heart</em> suggests it is based on <strong>Gratitude</strong>. Faith is the root, but gratitude is the soil. Evil deeds are often merely evidence that one's inner faith is flawed or purely outward.

<h4>The Danger of the Bubble</h4>
<p>Isolation is not a cure for chaos. When an individual or community builds a "bubble" to hide from the world, the internal entropy eventually revolts. The higher light only flows through unconstricted vessels; trying to fight the laws of chaos through isolation only results in the chaos overtaking the smaller radius of the bubble even more violently.</p>
