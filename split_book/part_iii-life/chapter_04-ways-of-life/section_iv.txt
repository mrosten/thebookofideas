[TITLE: The Accidental Path]
<h4>The Discovery of Letting Go</h4>
<p>Many of the greatest breakthroughs in human history were not found by intense searching, but by the act of <strong>letting go</strong>. Einstein reached Relativity only by sleeping on it; Newton was prompted by a falling apple; Descartes founded Analytic Geometry while watching a fly crawl across his ceiling. When you let go of a thought, its essence enters the "Surrounding Light" (<em>Makif</em>), where it finds its proper place and returns to you as a revelation.</p>

            const isScattered = document.getElementById('scatter-view').checked;
            document.getElementById('view-scatter').style.display = isScattered ? 'block' : 'none';

<h4>Haste and the Hour</h4>
<p>The Sages warn: "He who presses the hour, the hour presses him." There is a rhythm to spiritual success. If one has a sudden, impulsive urge to do a good deed, it may actually be a "bad sign"—a distraction from the long, steady work required for true growth. Stubbornness is an anchor; true <em>mitzvot</em> are built of patience, even while we act without delay when the proper time arrives.</p>

<strong>The Mirror of Hatred</strong>
Hatred is a spiritual toxin because we eventually become that which we hate. The side of holiness never seeks destruction, only correction. The ultimate defense against an enemy is to judge them on the "Scale of Merit" and pray for their good; your prayer acts as a mirror, reflecting its blessing back onto you while neutralizing the shadow of the conflict.
