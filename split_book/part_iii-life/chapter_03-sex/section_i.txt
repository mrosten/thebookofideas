<h4>The Spiritual Reaction</h4>
<p>Sex is never merely physical. It demands to be treated with respect as the bonding of two souls into one. When it is treated as purely sensual, it reacts against the individual like a jealous wife, exacting a price in the form of internal anger and spiritual depletion. True sex is a spiritual bonding; if it remains on the level of the "merely physical," it spells the end of the relationship's depth.</p>

<h4>Sparks in the Pleasure</h4>
<p>Pleasure itself is on the level of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil—neither good nor bad in its essence, but dependent on its use. If one brings up the "sparks of holiness" within that pleasure, the soul ascends. Pleasure for the sake of God is like a sacrifice; it is the "Arousal of the Below" that prompts a corresponding flow from the Above.</p>

<strong>Joseph: The Foundation of Souls</strong>
In an era where true matches are rare, God draws souls through the "Level of Joseph" (the <em>Sephirah</em> of Foundation). Just as Joseph was a magnet for the spiritual "ascent" of others, the sanctification of the sexual act acts as a magnet for higher souls to enter the world.
