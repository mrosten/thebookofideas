<h4>The Spiritual Root</h4>
<p>Every family is a tree. Your close friends and family are not merely social connections; they are vital organs of your own soul. To cut yourself off from your roots is to risk spiritual dehydration. The soul is not "ripe" at eighteen; like fruit, it needs to stay attached to the tree until it can draw its own strength from the sun.</p>

<h4>The Protective Circle</h4>
<p>At age eighteen, a young person is often targeted as a "resource" by institutions seeking to harvest their energy. However, the protective light (<em>Makif</em>) of one’s father and the broader family circle does not reach its full strength until age twenty. Separation too early cuts the soul off from its primary source of defense.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>Makif: The Protective Commitment</strong>
Just as marriage provides an outer light that wards off negative forces, the commitment of family members to stick together through "ups and downs" creates a spiritual field of protection. This commitment is the root from which all successful political systems—monarchy, democracy, even socialism—draw their spiritual energy.

<p>When the storm comes, the family must "accept and exist"—lower the head, allow the wave to pass, and remain rooted together. The temptation to separate is often a test; true growth occurs by staying firm and refining the common root beneath surface differences.</p>
