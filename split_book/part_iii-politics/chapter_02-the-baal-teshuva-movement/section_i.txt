<h4>The Magic Helper</h4>
<p>Modern psychology identifies a profound "fear of freedom" that drives individuals toward authoritarian structures. When the burden of responsibility for one's own life becomes too heavy, many seek a "magic helper"—a therapist, a guru, or a religious leader—to whom they can surrender their autonomy. While rational authority (intended for the growth of the individual) is a tool for holiness, non-rational authority (which seeks to keep the subject indefinitely dependent) is an "escape from responsibility" that stunts the soul's development.</p>

                <h5>The Path to Autonomy</h5>
                <p>True authority acts like a parent or an expert teacher: its ultimate goal is to make the subject self-sufficient. By providing a framework of truth and law, it empowers the individual to eventually face the world with confidence and trust in God.</p>

                <h5>The Closed Loop</h5>
                <p>Non-rational authority thrives on the subject's perpetual need for guidance. This is often the shadow side of "indoctrination" movements, where the newcomer is stripped of their outside ties (family, friends) and made entirely dependent on a network that never fully integrates them.</p>

<h4>The Sovereignty of the Self</h4>
<p>Confidence that God truly runs the world allows a person to face the future without the "moral support" of a vast, anonymous group. While sticking with one's family and true friends is vital, the "Small Prophecy" of the inner heart remains the ultimate guide. One person cannot "touch what is meant for someone else," and thus, the true religious path is one of increasing independence and personal accountability within the wider covenant of the Law.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>The Therapy of Responsibility</strong>
The popular pseudo-science of modern psychotherapy often serves as a manifestation of this fear. By treating moral values as "projections" and responsibility as a "myth," it creates a scientific tyranny that encourages the individual to adjust to the group rather than finding their own unique light. The true saint is often the one who refuses to fit in.
