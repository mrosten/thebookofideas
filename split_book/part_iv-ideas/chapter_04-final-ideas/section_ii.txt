"Spirituality is determined not by the vertical level, but by the horizontal closeness to the Light." — The Totem of Ranks.

<h4>The Coordinates of the Soul</h4>
<p>Common religious thought views spirituality as a vertical "Totem Pole" or ladder where some people (e.g., Jews, scholars) occupy high rungs and others occupy lower ones. However, the true measure of a person's soul is not their *y-coordinate* (rank/starting point) but their *x-coordinate*—their horizontal closeness to the "Vertical Column of Infinite Light." A person on a high rung (born into a pious family) who remains far from the column is less spiritual than a person on a low rung (a newcomer or non-Jew) who draws closer to the light. Good and evil are horizontal choices, not vertical inheritances.</p>

                <p>The vertical hierarchy defines only the potential of the vessel. Being "Jewish" or a "Scholar" determines which world the individual operates in, but it does not automatically yield holiness. One can be at a "high" rung and still be evil, or at a "low" rung and be righteous.</p>

                <h5>The Distance from Light</h5>
                <p>The horizontal axis is the domain of personal will. Even on the "Left" side of the ladder, there is a right and a left. A person who is considered "evil" by communal standards may still possess a spark of goodness if their internal x-coordinate is closer to the Infinite Column than a complacent "righteous" person.</p>

<h4>The Fabric of Tradition</h4>
<p>The history of a community is often a mixture of authentic light and politically motivated fabrication. Authentic traditions from Rabbi Nachman are preserved in only five books—three of his exact words and two from his disciple Rabbi Nathan. Modern claims that "there would be no other Rebbe after him" are often convenient inventions used to protect a community's political or financial interests. Recognizing the difference between a Divine Commandment and a social "fence" is the first step toward reclaiming one's horizontal agency in the face of institutional pressure.</p>

<strong>The Sin of the Scholar</strong>
A scholar may use semantics and "Lamdanut" (dialectic skill) to stretch the truth beyond recognition, such as Abraham claiming Sarah was his sister. However, when faced with a direct Commandment from God, a true saint abandons all dialectic maneuvers. They do not try to find a way out through semantics; they move directly toward the Column of Light, recognizing that the Divine Will is the sole definition of both truth and kindness.
