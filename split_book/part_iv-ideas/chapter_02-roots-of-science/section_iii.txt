It is

probably obvious to most scientists

but since I

haven't seen this mentioned anywhere, I think it is proper to say this. The

inverse square laws are a result of the fact that the surface area of the

sphere is

, i.e., since the force

coming out of any object is diluted over the area of a sphere the further out

you go, gravity or the electromagnetic force must be reduced by a factor of r

Every

physical body has extension into imaginary space (not the fourth dimension, but

into space times 'I'). This makes every mass, even if in a random chaotic

shape, symmetrical. If you stop the vibrations at the nodes, you increase the

frequency which increases the energy. This particularly should apply to the

strings of which the atom is made. Also, to the galactic strings, so that at

places where the galaxies don't form there should be an increase of energy.

[Looking at this now I am not so sure for wasn't that the independent variable

idea with the electron i.e., how someone wanted to explain the uncertainty of

electron, and I seem to recall that was refuted experimentally. However, the

imaginary numbers do seem to pop up in the most common places like electric

The order

of adding up the electrons to the chemical elements and the order of the

unification table and the order of the table for proving the equivalence of the

set of positive rational fractions with all natural numbers [Cantor's diagonal

method] and the way of doing certain continuous integrals like <???>
