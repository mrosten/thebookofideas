the worlds was horizontal, then it changed to vertical e.g., the mitzvah of

teffilin had all the other mitzvot in it, like Shabbat of tefillin, prayer of

tefillin etc. Then it was changed to take the tefillin of all the other mitzvot

and put them into tefillin so that tefillin is only tefillin, i.e., tefillin of

Shabbat, tefilin of prayer etc., this happened in all the world so the order of

all the worlds was switched. The sixteen levels of this GUT relate to the

sixteen components of the stress energy tensor (even though it reduces down to

ten components) which is related on the next parallel level of the Typo-genetic

Code by which each pair of ACGT codes for an amino acid, thus;

Each

level of the hierarchy of Creation is based on similar matrices. This is why

the diagonal functions keep showing up like the trace [for Cantor], the

determinant [for the volume of the universe], characteristic polynomials, the

relation between each level of creation is thus;

If A is

the matrix of the Genetic Code and B is that of the table of the elements, then

A = P

- 1

BP. Now

we have to find Matrix P to get the connection, and P
