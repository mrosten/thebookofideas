(beauty) [Or in the new notation (top0(bottom)] and the six leptons are the 6

sephirot of nukba, while the light is drawn from the higher sephirot. Another

way of looking at it is the particles correspond to the right hand and left

hand sephirot i.e.,

wisdom

,

kindness

,

victory

= top, charm

up and understanding, power, splendor = strange, down, bottom and the middle

interaction gluons are the middle mediating sephirot.

The

wave-particle duality is from the root of the circular and straight sephirot

which led to the two worlds Akudim (streaked-waves) and Nekudim

(dotted-particles), which in turn led to the doubts that arise in the raisha

delo isyada (the peak that is impossible to know, which the

Eitz Chayim

goes into great length to explain what the doubts that are that are there. It's

interesting to note the doubts of the uncertainty principle arise from the wave

particle duality and the doubts in the unknown peak arise from the duality of

the streaked and spotted worlds.

Electro-magnetic

waves are a combination of the light of 45 and 52 -- (45 is the electric part).

·

The

Lorentz transformation is identified in terms of 10 parameters:

·

The relative velocity.

·

The 3 top sephirot.

·

The angles between the spatial coordinates

(the 3 middle sephirot), and

·

The space-time coordinates of the origin of

one coordinate system with respect to the other (the 4 lower sephirot).

Since

velocity corresponds to the 3 higher sephirot, the velocity of light is the

same in all frames of reference -- since it is above space and time. (The

concept of the higher 3 sephirot being above space and time is a very common
