imagine that the universe does form a loop and though gravity doesn't form

loops on a small scale perhaps it does on a large scale. Perhaps this could

explain the fact that the galaxies don't fly apart. If gravity is in fact like

the electromagnetic force, if it would change over the course of time, you

would get its counterpart. Now any accelerating system like the earth and the

sun [or the galaxy] is changing over time, so perhaps this system is emitting

some other type of waves besides gravitational waves. Yet since the density of

the galaxy is so small, we just don't notice it.

The light

of the sephirot isn't all the same, but the light of 52 is a spiritual-electric

field and the light of 45 is a magnetic field and together they create a

spiritual electromagnetic wave by the oscillation of the name 52 at the top of

the empty space.

just like

because speed is a

measure of space-time like length is a measure of space. So, the force that

turns energy to matter is an inverse square force. (So, if c was a variable,

the less it would be, the more mass you would have, so c

the acceleration of light? And after that, I guess, would be the change in the

acceleration with respect to time, and so for every dimension up you add.

Current

is described by a differential equation that has a solution only with a complex

number. Perhaps that is because mass has a complex part of itself as in
