factor of k again

since your inspiration was increased by by that amount. So you get

(inspiration) (k

2

)

If you do that n times, your inspiration will be (inspiration) (

k

2

). Now

back to the beginning. At the time you did the second repentance you also do a

repentance on your first repentance since your realize that it wasn't complete.

The first time you repent on your first repentance you get some inspiration.

The second time you get (inspiration)(k). The next time you get (inspiration)

(k

2

). Now, at the time you do your third repentance on the sin, and

the second repentance on the first repentance, you do your first repentance on

the second repentance.

So at the

time you have done this process n times you have Inspiration(kn) + inspiration (kn-1)

+…+ inspiration. If you take the limit as you do this an infinite number of

times you get the  Integral(inspiration) (kn)] dn = (Inspiration) (kn)/(ln k)

where the ln k signifies the lower dot of the

aleph

[the Divine name 52]

and the dividing sign is the line dividing the

aleph

and kn is the top

dot of the

aleph

[the Divine name 161].

The way

of learning of Rabbi Nachman includes two different points. One that just by

saying the words the understanding comes into the mind. The other is to learn

in order without skipping around. My idea of saying the words backwards comes

from the Ari and the aal Shem Tov who have different unifications based on that

idea, and the Ramchal explains in his

New Zohar

that the saying

of the words backwards brings the light back to the source -- so it's like

sewing -- where it is helpful to go backwards also. The practical way of

implementing this is to have a place marker in the several books that one needs

to learn and have a certain fixed amount that one does of each one each day.
