In that

same lesson in the

Lekutai Moharan

, vol 1. chapt. 6, we see that the

amount that the honor of God is increased depends on how much the person has

changed from a state of sin to the state of good and the change one has of

greater honor to lesser, i.e. the honor of God isn't dependent on one's being

good but rather on change from a lower to a higher state, and similarly there

is a need for an active lessening of ones own honor. Therefore the proper

relationship is

:

Honor of God =

D

State of goodness

is that

goodness or

Self-honor

.

Since

these are two independent variables as we take the limit as

The

general solution of this linear partial differential equation will contain two

arbitrary functions. I think they are the finding of one's proper partner as

mentioned in Lekutai Moharan [vol 2] and becoming included in the Higher Man

who sits on the Throne which is the result of doing the higher and lower

repentance of chap. 6. This would explain why these two things result from the

higher and lower repentance mentioned in this chapter [i.e., chapter 6 of the

Lekutai Moharan]

If one

has masturbated he should say the 10 psalms, 16, 32, 41, 42, 57, 77, 90, 105,

137, 150 and immerse himself in a natural body of water all on that same day as

Rabbi Nachman said.
