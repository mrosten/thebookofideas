are from the four letters of the Ineffable Name. The ten components of the

Einstein tensor (the rearrangement of the Ricci tensor) which deals with the

curvature of spiritual and physical space-time is the source of the

gravitational field.

The

energy stress tensor describes the 10 straight sephirot and the Einstein vector

is the 10 circular sephirot - Einstein figured out that they must be

proportional - I'm just saying the same thing for the sephirot like he said for

the vectors.

What this

means is that the spiritual powers of the commandments and the ten statements

as they condense into the physical realm become the energy stress tensor and

the Einstein vector tensor. [That is, the commandments are a measure of the

spiritual mass-energy (vessels and light) energy density and momentum of a

person], this involves an approach to the sephirot different than the regular

one, for here we are saying that the first 9 describe the components of the 3-d

tensor which traditionally would be just 6 sephirot.

Thus,

there are twenty amino acids which correspond to the twenty symbols of TNT

which correspond to the twenty components of the curvature of four dimensional

space, which correspond to the twenty components of the Einstein tensor and the

mass energy tensor that have to be proportional according to Einstein. [See

page 533 of Gödel, Escher, Bach].

Also,

there are ten equations that describe a fluid in four and ten quantities that

characterize that fluid corresponding to the ten sephirot of yosher and the ten

of igulim...The correlations thus;
