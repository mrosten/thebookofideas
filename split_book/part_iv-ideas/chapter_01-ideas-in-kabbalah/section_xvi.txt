The

Divine name, which indicates that God is the Force of forces is “God”, or

“Elohim”. The five letters of this name correspond to the five components of

the equation for the total force on any specific volume, oyhla = F(total) =

n cosTds. The basic three letters are the basic name

which is the basic equation with the dot after the

lamed

indicating the

dot product and the mistakes the word plural and thus indicates the sum of all

the forces which is the integral sign. In its inner essence this equation is

the divine name of the four letters

hvhy.

The

h

is the

ds, the small surface, the

y

is the tension, the

v

is the

normal to the surface and the first

h

is the

cos

of the angle between the tension and the normal to

the surface.

Now this

is the scheme of Creation as we can see on every levelfrom this diagram of the

the Genetic Code, the Godel Code together with the order of the higher worlds

and the

formula for the curvature of space -time.
