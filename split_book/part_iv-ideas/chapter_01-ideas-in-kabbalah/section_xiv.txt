However,

the general system according to the Kabbalah is that the top row of the matrix

is the beginning letters of every word of the verse, the middle row of the

matrix is the middle letters, and the last row is the last letters of each

word. So, for example the first verse is a 3 times 7 matrix.

The

reason the world is 3 dimensional is that it is built by the Divine name 72

which consists of three letters for each name which are each orthogonal to each

other. [This is based on the verse “the world is built by kindness”. The name

72 corresponds to the Divine trait of Kindness.]

The 4

times 4 matrix of the four Divine names 72 63 45 52 is:

Actually, the intentions of the Ari in general are matrices. This fact makes
