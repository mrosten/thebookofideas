dissolves — Isn't that Tensor space?]

In

general, the Kabbalah seems to deal only with totally arithmetic operations

[gematriot], except it hints to the other types of space only occasionally,

e.g., when the Ramak brings down that:

é

2

+ +

ä

2

å

2

+

ä

2

= 186 =

place [makom]

which

indicates that this is a 4-d place, and that a norm comes out to be the square

root of 186... The 5 forms (partzufim) have their origin in the 5 flows from

the name 72, 63, 45, 52, which are Gravitational, Strong, Weak,

Magnetism-Electricity.

The

relationship between the circular sephirot and the straight ones is that the

10-component curvature tensor of the circular sephirot is proportional to the

10-component energy-stress tensor of the straight ones.

(The Eitz

Chayim seems clear that the basic existence of vessels, or what we call ‘matter’

is in the straight sephirot, and matter is best represented by the

energy-stress tensor).

The

constant of proportionality should be decided in a way that the normal 613

commandments for Jews and 7 commandments for the children of Noah should be

reproduced under normal circumstances of weak fields and small velocities

[i.e., that these basic laws of human conduct are invariable in all frames of

reference and it is possible to understand their application in all situations

if we can know the constants and exact formula, for, as of now I understand

that the laws of the Torah are eternal and unchanging yet their application is

unknown in many circumstances.]

The 10

components of the energy-stress tensor in the spiritual

realm

which

describe the distribution and flux of energy and linear momentum of

every sepherah or soul. This tensor follows the four laws of continuity which
