T = itk + jtb + ktv + ltw + mtc. (This

involves more than ten components).

The Empty

space should be limited to some dimensions, not infinite dimensional, and the

straight light coming down should be one dimension less. The reason I think it

has to be finite dimensional is so that a description of it will be necessary

and sufficient. Only to God is the near the same as the far but as we describe

distances and time even in a spiritual way the description has to be confined

to some limited number of dimensions to have any meaning.

The empty

space rotates on its axis and revolves around a center point and one outside

itself and this produces the flux's that enters it. The rotation causes it to

be in the form of an ellipsoid i.e.

The empty

space has the quality of hiding the light of God, and every level of hiding

hides the previous level so one doesn't know that God is hidden and thinks he

is close to God. And that level is hidden by another level in a continuous

progression. Each level is a different level of darkness. The character of

God's Infinite Light is that as it progresses further down through the darkness

it illuminates one more level of hiding. Every higher level of light that comes

into the world defuses a greater degree of darkness.

Since the empty space is rotating it

must have an ergosphere.

The

singularity in the center of the empty space is connected to the light

surrounding the space through an outside dimension.
