The

proportionality of the ten components of the Einstein tensor and the energy

stress tensor are parallel to the ten sephirot of the point of wisdom and the

ten of the point of understanding. However, there must be another ten-component

tensor that we are not aware of since there is also the ten sephirot of the

point of the crown which hasn't been accounted for. [I am assuming the 6 sephirot

of Zeir and the one of

malchut

relate to just the physical manifestation

of the higher points.]

The

question, however, is how is the breaking of the vessels reflected in the

physical realm? Is this the law of uncertainty that will be rectified after the

revival of the dead? How can a law that is so much in the fabric of the

universe be rectified? Don't we correct the breaking of the vessels every day

by prayer, and certainly the law of uncertainty doesn't change from day to day.

The answer apparently is that this law also has its roots in the circular sephirot

which will be united with the straight ones at the revival, but not change

their essential character.

A more

traditional approach would be that in 5-d spiritual space the three dimensions

are 6 lower sephirot as per the directions of Rabbi Luria for the lulav, (we'll

call the entire kindness and anti-kindness (power) direction just by k, beauty

and anti-beauty (foundation) by b, and victory and anti-victory (splendor) by

v. Then crown and anti-crown (royalty) we'll call c, and Wisdom and
