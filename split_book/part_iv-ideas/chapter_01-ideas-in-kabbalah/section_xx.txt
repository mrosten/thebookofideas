The ten

traits of the five basic sephirot are bases for those sephirot. i.e., they are

linearly independent.

The Zohar

says there are nine palaces above the sephirot that are not light or spirit or

souls. They are, in the spiritual realm, the equivalent of the nine components

of the force-density tensor.

This is

because they are made, as the Zohar says, by the impulses of the nine lower sephirot

on the crown. [Even though I have not seen this anywhere, I suppose these nine “palaces”

are the eight white hairs of Arich, and the first

tikun

of the beard

which come to Zeir Anpin.]

tx = Understanding(= Txxi)

Knowledge (= Txyj) +

Wisdom (= Txz k)

ty = Power (= Tyxi) +

Beauty(=Tyyj) +

Kindness(=Tyzk)

tz=Splendor (= Tzxj) +

Foundation(=Tzyj) +

Eternity (= Tzzk)

These are

not the sephirot but the result of the sephirot hitting the crown. And they are

the vessels of the infinite light which is

The

correspondence between the circular and straight sephirot is clearly the basis

of the lower world of logic and will, and then the physical creation as we can

see from the following diagram
