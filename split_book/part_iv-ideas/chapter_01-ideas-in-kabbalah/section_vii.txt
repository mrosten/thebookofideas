Y is the

distance from the light to the top of the empty space.

is the distance to the

side of the wave of the Infinite Light as it vibrates.

[IMAGE: image013.gif]

is the velocity of the

wave which is

for light:

c=(?)(T/r).

(

T is the

tension of the empty space (?) is the density.)

If

f

is a regular mapping of a good deed on a surface of the soul or onto the

surface of the empty space, then for every point there is a coordinate patch

on the soul such that

Resistance

in the higher sephirot of emanation is a characteristic of the vessels of the sephirot

without which they couldn't shine out their own light (they would still allow

the infinite light of God to radiate from within them, but with resistance they

form a R-L-C circuit, and they emanate their own unique frequency of light).

The frequency of the light coming into the empty space is infinite, and only

lessened by its coming into the circular sephirot.

Each

sephirah is a sphere only in its own dimension it's a hollow cylinder with

respect to the higher one, like a circle is only closed in flat-land but with

respect to the three dimensional world it is hollow. Thus, the sephirot are

closed with regard to observer in spiritual 4-d space but a long cylinder from

the aspect of 5-d space. The probability density of the vessel of each sephirah

varies inversely as the square of the distance from the center since density of
