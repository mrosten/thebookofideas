them for their good deeds in a temporary world. The reason is because if they

are mainly sinful God gives them their main reward in the world which is the

main and most important, i.e., the next world. Those that have a majority of

good deeds God rewards them in the next world for their good deeds and punishes

them here for their bad deeds. Thus, one who is mainly good will suffer unless

he has no sin at all. Now this is certainly in accord with Genesis - but I

would like to say that it also goes along with the rest of the Torah. For, the

places in the Torah where it guarantees reward for good deeds is always in

plural and referring to the Jewish people as a whole. So, it only is saying if

the 51% of the people are good, then 51% will have good. They might be 49% of

the bad and 2% of the good who will have good. At any rate in this world the

evil people succeed and have money, children, and happiness. Yet, God gives

good to the righteous eventually by preserving them, even if it is in a lowly

way and by raising their horn [honor and happiness in the end.]

If the

majority of one's deeds are good, he is rewarded in the

Gan Eden

of

Earth by the light of God shining upon him here and punished for his bad deeds

in this life by bad events. If the majority of one's deeds are evil, he will be

punished in hell and here on Earth have physical comfort. However, for good

words one is rewarded in the lower Gan Eden and punished for his bad words in

this world if the majority of his words are good in quantity and quality. If

the majority are lies or evil talk, he is punished in hell and rewarded for his

good words here. If the majority of his thoughts and feelings are good, then he

is rewarded for them in the higher

Gan Eden

.
