Israel of Koznitz

said a mitzvah that comes suddenly is usually from the evil side.

·

In all these

principles there are contradictions. So, I think the best thing is to make a

hierarchy of advice principles. The first being if you know you are not capable

of a correct decision then put it in God's hands.

The irony of it all

is that every attempt to bring Utopia to humankind seems to result in increased

chaos and suffering.

·

Why is it that the

experts always seem to know the least and to be lacking common sense? This is

not that people in general are all that much better. But the “experts” seem to

have a knack for getting on the wrong track. When I was young, I was convinced

that the reason for this was that experts are usually mediocre minds that have

done the work to get where they are. Then, in their position of power, their

inherent absence of talent manifests itself. This is probably correct.

But I must change

this idea. For my original idea was that all intelligence is one. This may be

true but nowadays I think talent tends to be very selective. Even Leonardo Da

Vinci had art and invention but no other fields. I used to say this was from

lack of time to go into everything. But now I think it simply may be talent is

selective. Of course, even after one has talent nothing can replace that spark

of inspiration one needs from God. For this reason, I believe fear of God is

important for creativity.

To answer questions

in life - no coin flips. No trying to get inspiration.

There is:

1.

First impression.

2.

Basic feeling.

3.

Doing the work to find out.

Not people's advice.

[There is enough in

his Godliness for every creation. Be satisfied with what godliness he gives

you.]

The is the problem of

listening to rabbis even though they may not be wise, perhaps puts one on the

wrong track - or just reinforces the already wrong track that one is on.
