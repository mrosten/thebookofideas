Logical thinking results in a creation of

value or of no value depending on the path of the logic taken by the mind. Many

paths may seem logical to the mind with only one resulting in some valid

result. To find that path one needs the help of the soul.

Zeno's

proof that there is no motion is that before an object can go any distance it

has to go half that distance. And before it can go that much it has to go a

half of the last amount. Thus, by an infinite progression it is impossible to

move since the object always has to travel an infinitesimal amount — and

infinitesimal amounts can't add up since you need an infinite amount of them to

add up to anything.

It has

seemed to me in general to answer Zeno's paradox to say that space is

quantized

. Just like there is no time below Plank time, there is no

space past a certain point. However, Calculus derives motion by reducing the

distance of the motion down to an infinitely small amount and by this it

derives the true equations of motion.

So

apparently there is a reality to an infinitesimal amount in the real world?
