ut the idea of God's oneness is that the One God created

everything and controls everything.

The idea

of the Torah that

:

“

There is nothing besides Him [God]” is that only God

has true existence and everything else derives its existence from him

constantly.

Gods

being one has to mean one substance, not one quality or quantity because if He

is one quality and one quantity then he is by definition already two things.

When the Torah says God is one, it doesn't mean continuous since then God would

be divisible. If one means indivisible -- it says that nothing exists besides

God since everything is included in or part of his Godliness -- then nothing

can have quality or quantity. If it means the essence of God is one, and the

essence of everything is God, then to be good or evil is the exact same thing!

Rather it

is like I said above -- the intention of the Torah is that there is a Creator

and that creator is one, the one cause of existence. These arguments I got from

Aristotle (in his Physics) who used them to refute the idea that all being is

one.

Idea - Coming to

Absolute Knowledge:

Rabbi

Nachman held that absolute knowledge is possible only by revelation

. And

if one lacks that, then he can depend on faith.

H

e held that there is some point that the human mind can't

cross in order to come to absolute knowledge without faith. Rabbi Nachman

believed

that one can come to faith by prayer.

It seems

that in this, Kant and Rabbi Nachman agreed -- that by pure reason, a-priori

knowledge is not possible. This seems to be vindicated by Quantum Mechanics

for, as in quantum mechanics, the reality we perceive is affected by our

perception of it.

Reason

then, would be needed for the clarification of revelation. It is clear that

reason has a higher place than faith in Rabbi

Nachman's

schema, as the first chapter of the

Likutei

Moharan makes clear. But to come to make that final step to God, even with
