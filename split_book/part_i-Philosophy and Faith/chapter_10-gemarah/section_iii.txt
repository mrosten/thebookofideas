Rambam on putting ornaments on the streets of Jerusalem on the festival after

the destruction of the Temple. — and the Raavad there, and the Rosh at the

beginning of

Masechet Avoda Zarah

.) [The importance of not adding on any

restrictions is to keep the patterns of chaos of each person's soul which comes

from the circular sephirot and

provides

the energy

of serving God.]

Without

the ideas of the science of Chaos, it is hard to understand why the Torah

commands us not to add to the commandments.

The laws

of the written Torah are invariant. But the Jewish people are in an inertial

frame of reference as compared to Mount Sinai, so all explanations which are

direct traditions from Sinai always apply to them but not to non-Jews who are

in an accelerating frame revolving around the empty space. Different

formulations apply to them. Now even in the written Torah many laws are given

that apply only in Israel like a gas that obeys the gas laws when it is in a

state of equilibrium. When not in that state the only way to describe [until

now] is by statistical methods. That is why since the  the laws of the Torah

are statistically valid, but in cases keeping the law would invalidate its

purpose to Rabbi Shimon, the law doesn't apply. Perhaps Solomon’s mistake was

that there was a state of equilibrium in his days.

Many of

the laws of the Torah are based on probability, e.g., the majority of judges in

civil cases, and majority opinion in religious cases. It's OK if the Torah has

statistical laws because probability is part of the fabric of the spiritual and

physical universe. Before the case comes to court it's a wave pattern where all

the facts co-exist in mathematical wave form. But once it's in court the facts

are observed and reduced to particle form. [The majority of Rabbi Nachman's

advice is in fact statistical, not absolute. He simply describes the forces at

work in each mitzvah but the actual effects in each person's life will be based

on many factors. Like wearing

tzitzis

saving one from bad advice. It can

cause one to get bad advice also by getting involved with religious hypocrites.

However, Rabbi Nachman is referring to some degree of a spiritual effect that

the

tzitzis

do have.]
