The

commandments are on the level of Royalty and so one word of learning Torah is

worth more than all the commandments together even if done with absolute

perfection. Yet Science is on the level of Understanding and thus one word of

science is worth more than all the words of Torah. Kabbalah is on the level of Wisdom

and prayer on the level of the Crown, and thus worth more than all others.

[This is true only in accord with the system of most of the later kabbalists,

not to the Reshash who puts the written Law on the level of action of

zeir

anpin

while the other kinds of learning in formation creation and emanation

of

nukbah

.(but that is only in the vertical system after the correction

anyway.)]

If we

would apply Rabbi Nachman's principle of just saying the words in order and to

have faith that eventually you will understand, to Mathematics, it would seem

to me that we would have a way that even the dullest student could become a

genius in Math. But if one does this because he thinks it makes sense, he will

cease to do it. But if one does it because he has faith in the saint who said

to do it, then he will continue and have success. However, I will say how it

works. Fear of God, and good and strong character traits provide the vessels

for the light. Then by being involved with it the light is drawn as an outer

light, that surrounds the person. By doing the exercises it enters into the

vessels.

There is

a principle called the love force. This force is a physical force that changes

reality. Therefore, the only real learning is by the love principle. For by

loving a subject you'll be able to break down the door in front of it. That's

one reason for Rabbi Nachman's idea of just saying the words in order and then

to go on without review. For if you love it that's all you need to get inside

the door.

My

impression is that whatever people do to make themselves more happy results in

their being more unhappy.
