To the

Rambam in the Guide [III:51] the division of people is (from highest to

lowest):

a.

The prophets (the Crown).

b.

The philosophers (Wisdom) [of the schools of

Aristotle and Plato, not the rival schools of Greek thought of Epicurus or the several

other types that the Sages and the Rambam didn't go for].

c.

The scientists (Understanding) (Jewish or

not).

d.

Those who keep the commandments and know the

Talmud. (Knowledge-Glory with Royalty).

e.

Those who keep the commandments (Royalty).

f.

Those that don't keep the commandments.

The

Rambam does stipulate that all should be facing towards the King [the

Intellect-God]

-

otherwise they are evil.

Yet, this

depends also on why they are turning from the King; if for pleasure then they

are from the

Klipa

of

Noga

, if for sin they are from the three

totally evil

klippoth

(this corresponds with Aristotle's division of

people that

believe

the purpose of life is to have pleasure), then political

people [those that do right for the sake of the right not honor], and those

that love and live the contemplative life.

This also

corresponds with the three worlds.

1.

The pleasure seekers have root

-

souls from the physical universe.
