2.

The political people [people keeping and

learning the laws of the Torah] from the world of Formation [on the level of

good and evil].

3.

Scientists and philosophers are from

Creation.

4.

The highest level of those attached to God

are from Emanation and included in Aristotle's contemplative category.

[The

religious divisions are horizontal and not vertical. Spiritual Judaism is on

the inside to the left [God's right], Legal Judaism is on the inside to the

right, Protestantism is just outside of Judaism on the left.

Catholicism

on the inside to the right. Islam is outside of both also

to the right and left etc.

However,

all this refers to the physical Jewish people or Christian people etc. But

since the Torah is given for every level and all time and all generations it

refers to the higher levels also. Thus, there is a spiritual Israel with souls

that are of Israel though their bodies are not, and

vice

versa

-

and this is on

the level of

Formation,

that is

,

political people or people involved with the separation of

good from evil in society in general.

So, it is

safe to assume that social minded people that are battling for the good of

society, not for

personal

honor are from the spiritual Israel of Formation. On the

next level up, those involved in contemplation of God and his works are from

the spiritual Israel of Creation

, p

eople

attached constantly to God are from the spiritual Israel of Emanation. But on

all these levels everything depends on

one's

intent so if one is involved in contemplation of God with some ulterior motive

he is not from the spiritual Israel, even though they are from Creation.
