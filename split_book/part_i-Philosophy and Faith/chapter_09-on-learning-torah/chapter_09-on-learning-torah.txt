Chapter 9 – On Learning Torah

·

It

is

clear that the Torah puts learning on a higher level than

doing good deeds. The actual idea is that deeds create the vessels to receive

the light. Since all Israel in their higher root are one

, if

someone whose root is from the world of

Action

is available to do the good deed and create the vessel,

it's

better for one whose root is in learning to sit and learn

and to draw the light. The philosophy of the Torah puts learning Torah above

prayer. The way to explain Rabbi Nachman is that speaking with God in a

personal way isn't the same thing as prayer, rather it is fulfilling the

command of being attached to God which is higher than Torah

,

prayer and good deeds and it is the light of the name 72.

In

learning Torah, or all learning in general,

it's

best to speak

out the words

quickly

and to say them in order

with no repeats or interruptions. Only when one has finished the whole book

should he then to go back and review it (as Rabbi Nachman said). It's also

helpful to say the words forward and backwards [i.e., to go to the end of the

page and then to go backwards] as is clear in the

Annulment of Judgements

of the Baal Shem Tov HaKadosh and in the unifications of Rabbi Luria to remove

bad spirits in the

Shaar Ruach Hakodesh

and in the corrections of Rabbi

Yehudah HaCHasid and the reason this helps is stated in the

Tikunim

HaChadashim

of the Ramchal and the

Eitz Chayim

of Rabbi Luria.

[I have

also found it useful for me to learn lying down on my back for light books and

on my stomach with the book on a lower surface for heavy books]. Rabbi Nachman

noticed an important part of human intelligence: its unique ability to see

over-all patterns. This is largely a subconscious process — and thus Rabbi

Nachman knew that the main absorption of learning is simply by reading —

whether one is aware of his understanding or not.

This is

dependent however on the type of light contained in what one is learning. For

Hebrew only contains inner light. The outer surrounding-light of Hebrew was

lost and has gone into other languages. Thus, for instance, only people that

learn the Bible in English get a feeling of the story line and the inner ideas

contained in the outer light. Another example is for instance the simple

meaning of the words “love your neighbor like yourself,” which has an impact in

English of actual love while in Hebrew the feeling of it is more like a slogan.

Fearing God or loving God are the same, for in Hebrew the connotation is more

like going to the minyan or not turning on a light on Shabbat, while in English

it means loving God.

Rabbi

Lutzato hints to the idea that Torah only has power when said forwards and

backwards. The Baal Hatanya explains the root in holiness of non-Hebrew letters

in

Torah Or

(and a hint to this is found in Rabbi Abulafia) and

therefore the same principle applies when learning whether in Hebrew or not.

·

The true

value of learning Torah is only when the intention is to serve God, not to

become a rabbi or use it make a living. When it is learned with the wrong

intention, it of necessity leads one to the wrong conclusions. Rabbis nowadays

can only be rabbis if they have learned the laws of how to kill animals and

taken tests to show that they know that subject well. Therefore, they have used

their Torah knowledge to get a piece of paper that would qualify them for a

position to make money. Therefore, they have learned at least some Torah for

the intent of making money. Therefore, in general it is forbidden to ask a

rabbi for guidance since that guidance will be incorrect. [This fact is hinted

to in the Talmud (Shabbat 139a), that all the troubles of the world come only

because of the judges of Israel)

[I don't

know what the other parts represent. We can't add them later because we are on

a different level. They can’t be the

would seem to be

logical].

Targum.

One class

from each one of the main four categories should be learned each day. For

instance: learn the Bible, then a class in halachah, then one in Talmud or

science, and then one in Kabbalah.

The Books

which come from Beauty of

Atzilut

are

Sipurai

Maasiot

[Crown],

Tanya

[Wisdom],

Noam Elimelech

[Understanding],

Likutai

Moharan

,

Sefer HaMidot

[six middle sephirot] [Malchut]. [This is

only to the

Rambam

and

Chovot Halevavot

]

This next diagram is a close up of physicality

of beauty (zeir anpin):

c: Crown.

There is the root of the five books of Moses

w: Wisdom

k: Kindness.

v: Victory.

u: Understanding.

p: Power.

s: Splendor.

In these

right and left hand sephirot are located the roots of the prophets.

k:

knowledge

b: beauty

f: foundation

In those

middle three sephirot are located the roots of the sacred writings [like the

psalms proverbs, etc]. The next diagram is a closeup of Formation of Royalty

[IMAGE: image005.gif]

The

middle three “pbk” [power, beauty, kindness] are the root of the three parts of

the Mishna

Seeds

,

Times

and

Women

. The lower three are the

roots of the three other parts

Damages

,

Sacrifices

, and

Purity

.

By learning the

mishnayot

Seeds one draws the light of the name mlp la

pla from the top four vessels into the vessel of kindness. By learning tractate

Times,

one draws from the light of the name myhla into the vessel of

Power. The tractate Women draw the light of the name tvabe into the vessels of

Beauty. By learning

Damages,

one draws the light of the name laa into

the vessel of Victory. Learning the tractate

Sacrifices

one draws the

light of the name myhla yhla hla laa into the vessel of S

plendor

.

Purity

draws the light of yds into the vessel of F

oundation

.

So, the

entire Talmud is only the Talmud of the Nefesh [lowest level of the soul], not

the spirit or the soul

The

reason the Talmud is incomplete is that the souls of the Amoraim [rabbis of the

Talmud] were from Beauty of Emanation, from the time before

Zeir Anpin

was completed – i.e., the

Anshei Keneset Hagedola

were from knowledge of

Father coming down and the kabbalists of that period were from the same level

but going up… the

Tanaim

were from the six lower

sephirot

of

Zeir

Anpin

coming down and the

kabalists

among them were from the same

level but going up.

All the

above is on the level of Emanation but for the generality of the four worlds it

is thus;

the chapter I

deas in Science

], we have the diagonal such that we only

have the trace the things from the top left to the bottom right.

·

Every

level of Torah has a different inner light and meaning. Kabbalah is only the

inner meaning of Torah horizontally, not vertically. This is obvious from books

like the

Nefesh HaChayim

which says that the innerness of the words of

prayer is in the letters themselves not in the kabalistic intentions. Also, the

fact that the Torah says only a third verse can explain contradictions and not

any outside explanation means that the Torah is postulating an inner meaning to

itself in itself, not in the Oral law (since no outside explanations are

permitted). Soloke in number theory if it is consistent, it must be incomplete.

So, inside the Torah there must be a super-Torah. So, I postulate that the

system of Torah in the above diagram from the Rashash continues downwards [and

upwards.]

·

“To come

to the truth of science and Kabbalah is possible by prayer. One should

especially concentrate in the blessing Ahavah Raba before the Shema and in the

blessing ‘give knowledge’, in Shemone Esre.” -

from Reb Shemelke of Nickolsburg.

My theory

of learning is thus: When one gets up in the morning he is in a relaxed state

of mind. In my opinion this state is the only time any real learning can be

done. Talking with anyone or even saying ‘hello’ causes a break in the neuron connection

that causes any learning done after that to not be absorbed — for we see that

some things we learn and forget after some time. Yet other things stick inside

one permanently. Therefore, all real learning has to be done in the morning.

[The Baal

Shem Tov hinted to this, for he had a tradition from Achia HaShiloni that the

day one has anger in the morning he won't be able to learn anything after that.]

·

There are

many things in the

yidishkeit

[the practice of the Torah that

theoretically prescribe one way but in practice is otherwise. Sometimes, the

reason is that a person was created in a certain way such that the theory

doesn't apply to him. For instance; theoretically, I think it is clear from the

Zohar

that

Tikun Chatzot

is more important than v

esikin

.

However, I believe for many people the need for

Vesikin

outweighs that

of

Chatzot

because of their particular type of soul.

This may

apply also to living in Israel where clearly it it a great thing to all

opinions even to the Rambam; however, there are hidden things that cause it not

to be a

mitzva

.

In fact,

nothing in the Torah can you really know is a

mitzva

until you really

know what is going on in the hidden things. Just judging based on knowledge of

the halacha is worse than not knowing at all — for when one knows nothing then

he may follow his heart. If you ask then, why was the Torah given. The answer is

to teach us to go into our hearts to find God and give us the basic principles

that are really in our hearts and minds but from which we have become

estranged.

This is

the Rambam's opinion that all the commandments are really based on reason and

their force comes from the fact that they are already in our heart, not because

they are written. This applies to learning. For, in theory one should learn

slowly and review and not go further until he gets what he is learning now. But

in fact, in practice, it is better not to do it in that way. The reason is that

is the climbing way from the lower sepherah to the higher one step by step. But

since faith is connected to the crown, if one simply has faith and learns

simply, he comes to the highest knowledge, the knowledge that is higher than

knowledge the crown. This is signified by the way books are set up. For as one

reads from the top of the page to the bottom, he is going through the sephirot

that are containing in the inner logic of the book. Then as he returns, he has

effectively gone from crown to faith and back and this is absorbed into his

soul. [I think one should each day learn only the amount he has set for himself

to learn day by day, no more and no less].

·

Learning

doesn't make one spiritual. All the above mentioned spiritual levels are only

on the level of the spirit not the soul. Developing of one's spiritual self is

by prayer and meditation. One needs learning to provide the vessels to contain

the light of prayer and meditation, and one needs good deeds to contain the

light of learning. However, the drawing of the light is specifically by silent

thought. Action draws the

nefesh

; words of Torah draw the spirit, and

quiet thought draws the soul. This is something the Ari alluded to when he said

that unifications are higher than Torah [Saint Frances of Assisi also mentioned

this fact].

·

Rabbi

Nachman's way of learning is just to read the words out loud, and to do a

little bit every day of each book one needs to learn — and if you do it in

order and over the course of many years you will have completed at least once

all of the books of Science, Math, Kabbalah, Halacha, etc. And in the end, you

will understand much better than if you had labored over every point. But you

can only succeed in this if you have faith in Rabbi Nachman, since only by

faith will you have the stubbornness to continue this for many years before

seeing results.]

There is

a hint in the Torah that just by wanting to learn and understand one does merit

to it. For the work of the Tabernacle could be done only by the wise in heart

as it says several places in Exodus. And in Exodus 36:2 it says, “every person

wise in heart whom the Lord put wisdom in his heart, everyone whose heart

stirred him up to come close to the work to do it.” Thus, we see that God put

wisdom into the hearts of those who wanted to do the work.
