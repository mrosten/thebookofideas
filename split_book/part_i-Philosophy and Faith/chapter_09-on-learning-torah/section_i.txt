Chapter 9 – On Learning Torah

·

It

is

clear that the Torah puts learning on a higher level than

doing good deeds. The actual idea is that deeds create the vessels to receive

the light. Since all Israel in their higher root are one

bad spirits in the

Shaar Ruach Hakodesh

Yehudah HaCHasid and the reason this helps is stated in the

Tikunim

HaChadashim

of the Ramchal and the

Eitz Chayim

of Rabbi Luria.

[I have

also found it useful for me to learn lying down on my back for light books and

on my stomach with the book on a lower surface for heavy books]. Rabbi Nachman

noticed an important part of human intelligence: its unique ability to see
