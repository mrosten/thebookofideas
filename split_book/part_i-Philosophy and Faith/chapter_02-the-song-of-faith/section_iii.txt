religions as occupying the 7 lower

sephirot

, on the

axis. But

once you get up above religion into the 3 higher sephirot, the air has cleared,

so to speak, and we are closer to the light coming in from the upper–vertical

direction. Since good and evil are represented by the x–axis, even though we

may be lying above religion, we are neither good nor evil. The battle is not

between good and evil but rather between truth and mistake.

Perhaps

this explains the opinion of the Rambam that ‘the suffering of Job came because

he did not learn science and philosophy.’ Although he was righteous, he didn't

seek knowledge. Religion is on the level of the 7 lower sephirot which when one

gets involved in automatically causes him suffering. Usually he seeks for

answers in the religion, i.e., via a rabbi or a clergyman within the religion,

but from a higher perspective all knowledge is one.

Since

every person's soul is different, the laws of religion can never fit perfectly

with him. Accordingly, by nature, the results of one following the laws of any

religion, if applied with rigor, will then follow patterns of chaos – according

to each individual. If however the laws are applied in a more loose fitting

way, the affects on the person, following patterns of probability, will average

out—like the

binomial distribution

There is a basic distinction between the humanistic view and the

religious: namely, the humanistic view places great value on the concept of

freedom whereas the religious view does not consider it at all. The reason for

this may be reflected in that the source of the religious point of view is the

world–of–correction

,

tikun–brudim,

and the source of the humanistic point of view is the

world of

world–points

,

nekudim

. The ultimate correct way is to

have them included in the other.
