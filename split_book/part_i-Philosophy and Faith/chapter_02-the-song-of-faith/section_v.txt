’

s

religion

. Religion is

the

accumulation

of stories, songs and

religious general

consciousness

that one gains

as a child. If one “changes

” his

religion

all he is doing in fact is silencing himself — and say the

person goes into politics he might bring into the new group ideas left over

from his religious mindset — ideas that don’t belong there — ideas such as the

necessity of his way of life upon

all

(or death).

The

Catholics were very clever when they decided to incorporate various elements in

the religions that they conquered instead of banishing them. The Rabbi’s today

also, should

not

dismiss

anything of the culture of those that come to

them, unless he is keenly aware of what is involved (and what are the negative,

and acceptable elements in it).

The

Rambam explains why the Torah required sacrifices. And also regarding how some

of the philosophical tradition came to be incorporated in Judaism by the Sages

and the Rambam was also through this means. And today, the tendency of the

rabbis to take out of the Torah (through ignorance) the things that generations

ago were acceptable, only leads to the destruction of Torah life.

It is

obvious to me the grand departure from the ancient Torah way of life by the

Jews was the result of the rabbis not in being able to evaluate what really was

acceptable in tradition, and what (of what was new) was compatible.
