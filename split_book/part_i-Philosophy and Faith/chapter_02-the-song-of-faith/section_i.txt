Chapter 2 – The Song of Faith

Faith is

a

force

that

encompasses various forms. In scientists, it

takes a hold of them, causing them to seem to understand the world; and for

mystics -- the understanding of God. Devout people are guided by a different

Divine trait than non-devout. So, for example, non-devout people, by trusting

in God might not get their needs fulfilled unless they actually do something

physical for it;

whereas

for devout people,

they might have all their needs fulfilled through only faith. It might actually

be the opposite of the Divine will for them to do something about it!

According

to the Jewish viewpoint, most spiritual systems represent a valid frame of

reference in the local sense, as long

as

they fulfill

certain criteria. For Jews then, it must not deny the commandments of the

Bible, and for non-Jews, the validity of the 7

This idea

is reflected in a certain book of a Jewish mystic who lived during the Middle

Ages. He stated that it is forbidden for a Jew or Christian to convert to the

other's

faith since “he just mixes up the flow.” One may learn

from the other’s but not convert.

I believe, however, that all faiths hold mistakes that should be ultimately

corrected.

Today, it

is actually possible to test the validity of many statements of the Sages, for

they make empirically verifiable claims, i.e., certain actions causally

precedes certain results. With today’s methods of statistical analysis, it

would be a simple matter to conduct research on such issues.
