The main problem

with the worldview of religious fanatics is the vigor with which they insist

just how right they are. If one of their tenets is proved to be a mistake, say

through science, it is science then that has to be rejected. This can not be

held consistently. Those who believe have to have a high level of cognitive

dissonance

going on. Rabbi Nachman says that only faith combined with

knowledge is sturdy, and can not fall.

Every

religion has two aspects to it. The first aspect is the faith or individual

commitment and the search for God. This can be seen as being on the right of

I

believe, though, that if one learns enough and absorbs the learning into their

deep mind and soul, the force can reach critical mass and be able to break

through and produce new ideas. But most people reside on the subcritical level

and thus are merely on the “religious” level — spewing out what they have heard

(as Lucas wrote in 1961).

There

exists one

principle

to

inevitably good — for the person would usually find their way to prayer. The

effect of religion, however, on those not searching for God but for money or

power is bad, because they try to impose their will on others and thus

interfere with the harmonies.

There is

a special method of studying that is advocated by Rabbi Nachman. The method
