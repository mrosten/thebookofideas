Spinoza's Seven Axioms:

●

Everything

which exists, exists either in itself or in something else.

●

That

which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through

itself.

●

From

a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows and, on the other hand, if

no definite cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect can follow.

●

The

knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the knowledge of a cause.

●

Things

which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the one by means of the

other the conception of one does not involve the conception of the other.

●

A

true idea must correspond with its ideate or object.

●

If

a thing can be conceived as non-existing, its essence does not involve

existence

Spinoza Further Detail

As to B.

Russell's and Kants' criticism of Spinoza's proof of God, where they

differentiate between the existence of a thing and the idea of a thing, I must

mention that Spinoza deals with the true idea or the essence which isn't the

same as the idea. This however doesn't disprove Kant's major thesis. You need

Hegel for that.

Russell

didn't accept the concept of a strange loop and tried to disprove it by a

hierarchical method, but his principle of a self-consistent formal system

without loops has been disproven. Kant and Russell couldn't accept the fact

that a self-consistent formal system can be forced out of itself into a higher

or lower level of existence. Thus, they couldn't accept Spinoza's proof.

Spinoza does postulate cause and effect, so assuming this, would Kant say the

mind causes itself? If so then it would be God by Spinoza definition, and this

is apparently not the case anyway!
