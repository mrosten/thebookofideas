Idea - Flux of Secular/Religious Litvak/

Chasid

T

he

idea that nothing exists besides

God is on the level of, “He surrounds all

worlds''

, i.e., the

circular sephirot

. But on the level of the

straight sephirot

, in

which God fills all worlds, His life energy is divided among the different

levels that exist in the order of creation. That is, even though his infinite

light is everywhere and nothing exists besides It, It is not manifest in the

individual creations. The light that is manifest in individual creations is

divided by level. So there are the sparks of holiness in everything, which keep

those things existing on a manifest level. Then, there is the life force and

particular holiness inside

ideas

and

spirit, which keep those things existing

, and gives

to

them their individual character.

When one

concentrates on the idea of

their

existing,

nothing exists besides God, that is when the idea has the

most power. Just as matter cannot curve space unless it is in a concentrated

area, in the same way, this thought cannot draw the light of God unless one

really works at it.
