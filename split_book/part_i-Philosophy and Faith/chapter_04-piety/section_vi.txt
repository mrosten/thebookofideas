“One has

to be on the same wavelength as God to receive his Word, power receivers,

lifestyle

, or big antennas

“One has

to be rein trained, like power steering i.e., willing to listen to a small hint

from God and not to

sends his spirit to a person willing to obey small hints like Moses going aside

to see the burning bush.”
