The two

types of prayer are speaking with God when the light flows horizontally from

the circular sephirot and praying up to God when the light flows from the

straight

sephirot

, vertically. This is why by the graves of the

righteous it is usually easier to pray since the light is vertical, while away

from there one can only talk with God horizontally unless by some merit, he can

draw the vertical light upon himself.

The

reason one must pray very hard before he is answered is because the Zohar says

God is hidden and revealed. Which means that there are quantum states of

prayer. So just like in the atom if you put some small amount of energy into

the electron, the atom acts as a whole and hides its inner workings. Only if

you give it a lot of energy will the electron budge individually. Thus, it is

with prayer. Sometimes to get an answer you need to put a lot of time and

effort into your prayers.

Many

sages have offered a whole range of solutions to the problems of Yidishkeit

ranging from learning books of ethics and fear of God [

Musar

],

Chassidut

,

Kabbalah

,

Hisbodedut

,

extreme strictness in

Halachah

; some have offered different ways of

combining these things by doing a little of each every day. I believe that all

these things are merely tools. It's like climbing a mountain

:

some people are given one tool, and some are given all the

tools. Some are placed on an easier side of the mountain and some on a tougher

side. Not any one tool will work all the time for all the people or even one

person. Everything depends on the individual alone, his desire to get to the

top, his stamina, his perseverance, his intelligence, and understanding how to

use the tools. And even with all that he can still stick the chisel in the

wrong place! (Marry the wrong person and fall to his spiritual doom -- or

divorcing the wrong person), so one need's just plain help from God.
