reason is that sexual desire in itself is directed towards all females and thus

is a manifestation of the spirit of the species as to increasing the quantity

of the species, not the quality. [This idea is from Schopenhauer]. The reason

For

mitzvot

that you

don't feel light from you will not get any reward in the next world therefrom.

There really is not all that much difference between here and there. So, if you

don’t feel any light then believe me, there isn't any. This is why the Torah

only promises good in this world for doing the

mitzvot

.

Since the next world is not dependent on

mitzvoth

, only this world is.

However, if you feel the light then in all likelihood you are on the right

track for there too. However, since getting there is such a fragile thing it is

worth it to have a guarantee. So, this is why it is worth it to get to the

grave of Rabbi Nachman, say the ten psalms and give a penny for charity, in

which case he promised he would take that person that does this out of hell, an

unpleasant place by all accounts.

blessing except from the root one was born from as already mentioned by the

kabbalists from the Middle Ages. But there is another reason, i.e., that

religion is the images and stories

e

mbedded

into one's

consciousness

when he is young. One

can never change that, nor is it desirable to. One can always stick with his

own religion and just take out the things that are forbidden. True religion

isn't a bunch of rules, it is a way to approach God. And that can only be done

with the totality of

one's

consciousness.
