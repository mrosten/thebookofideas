turns into its opposite. But this is only if one doesn't

progress towards the origin (God) which dampens the oscillations. (The idea

that everything turns into its opposite [as the Sages said in terms of the poor

becoming

rich and vice versa; “There is a

wheel which is turning in the world.”] only applies on the level of the lower

six sephirot, not the top three, so

Science and Kabbalah tend to help one to

rise out of the rat race

.)

There is

the

sine

function for the day, week, month, year, life. There is in

every person's life one peak. After that they waste the rest of their lives

trying to get it back. Nothing leads to as much unhappiness as the pursuit of

happiness.

True

Enlightenment comes only once in a lifetime. As we see with Jacob that first he

had a great revelation from God and a great promise on his way to Laban. Then

on his way back he had to fight with God [i.e., God revealed himself again to

Jacob, but this time as a man and as an enemy.]

And then he

had years of trouble in Israel. After that he only had years of peace in Egypt.

For this world is only a preparation for the next. Here one must suffer the

love and wrath of God, and

only then

one c

an

become a man.

The

commandments aren't an automatic drawing of holiness. They are like functions

that you have to first put in the number 0. You have to draw the holiness by

love and fear of God (as per the

tikkunim

of Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato)

which come only by science and

kabbalah

(known to the sages by

the name, “Work of Creation”

,

and “Divine

Chariot''

, which the Sages of the Talmud call a great and important

thing, in relation to the Talmud which they call a small thing) as the Rambam
