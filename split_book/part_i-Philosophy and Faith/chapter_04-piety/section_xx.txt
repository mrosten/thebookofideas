guess as to what they might be based on the things that the Baal Shem Tov

himself was careful in, i.e.:

1)

Mikvah

2)

Praying at sunrise

3)

Learning in the way of just saying the words

quickly and without repeating anything.

I would

guess the things to learn would be the four categories that the Arizal said to

learn every day, i.e., the Bible, Halacha, Gemara,

Kabbalah

. (The Rambam held that science is in the category of

Gemara. So, this turns out to be the Bible, Halacha, Science,

Kabbalah

.

The three

unifications I would guess are the names 72,42 and 12.
