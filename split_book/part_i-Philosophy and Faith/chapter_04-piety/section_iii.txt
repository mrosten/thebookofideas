The

reason you have to pray alone in a closet or in a forest is that all spiritual

matter and energy are a wave attached to God; until it is observed, at which

point it is a particle. Like Rabbi Nachman said that observing something makes

a “vessel”, i.e., makes something have a specific place and time. It seems in

the Eitz Chayim that this was caused by the original breaking of the vessels in

nekudim

,

i.e., the original symmetry. For before that, there was no

reason to think that the vessels would have fallen just by being looked at. So,

it seems that in their original state they could have stayed connected to God

in their wave particle form even after being looked at. But I'm not sure about

this

,

since the breaking was apparently from

too much light coming at once, which seems like a macrocosmic event along the

lines of classical Physics.

On Nov.

19, 1619, Descartes crawled inside a large stove, and spent the day in privacy,

warmth, and darkness, meditating. There he had a vision - that everything, man

nature, the cosmos all work by means of Mathematical principles. That is by

hiding himself he got in contact with his higher root by becoming a wave. That

was right after the period of Rabbi Isaac Luria and Rabbi Joseph Karo, so

Kabbalah and Halacha had been brought to their perfection and the time for

science had come.

just as space-time manifolds have,

at each point, a double-cone of light-like directions.
