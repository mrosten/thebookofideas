of the Talmud said the first Chasidim used to wait one hour before and after

every prayer. Then it was asked in the Gemara, “Then for the three prayers

every day it comes out to be nine hours. When did they learn anything? The

Gemara answered, since they were Chasidim [i.e., pious] their learning was

guarded

/

blessed inside of them. To the person that said

“

guarded

”

it was only

guarded. To the person that said blessed, their learning

was

actually increased.” Now it is clear that they weren't

praying or learning but meditating. [Since the main problem in meditation is

the discipline needed, I suggest taking an oath to sit and do it for a certain

amount of time. An oath is a powerful tool because it turns a motivation to do

a good thing into a motivation not to transgress a very serious sin which is

stronger.

The idea of oaths was given by the Torah to help the weak of

spirit

. Incidentally an oath should only be taken day by day, never for

more than that since, “Who knows what tomorrow may bring?”
