it by some and not others? And the verse in Haazinu [Deut. 29:28] says to do

all the words of the Torah forever, but not to do

mitzvot

that were

given only for a certain time period forever. For instance, if a person would

sit in a

sukkah

on chanukah, he would not have a mitzvah. If you do a

mitzvah after

its

time period is over, you

also have no mitzvah. So, in Rashi's explanation, King David said the time to

keep the mitzvot that were not eternal is over. But he was not referring to

mitzvot like the Shabbat, which are. It seems to me

that the Mitzvot

mentioned in connection with the land of Israel are

eternal since the Torah gives them in order that we should inherit the land of

Israel

forever.

Now there

is a difference of opinion if the commandments are a goal in themselves. If we

take the Baal HaTanya's point of view, then one way to resolve that Rashi

,

except to say that the Baal HaTanya must hold like the

other

R

ishonim that explain that Gemara

differently. However, the

perush

on the Rambam explains that lower fear

of God [fear of punishment] is to bring one to the

mitzvot

and the

mitzvot

are to bring one to the higher fear [awe of God]. According to this Rashi it

comes out well. For since the commandments are specifically to bring one to awe

of God and King David [and the later prophets] saw that in their

generation

the

mitzvot

did not cause awe of God. Perhaps

that caused him to realize the time period was over.
