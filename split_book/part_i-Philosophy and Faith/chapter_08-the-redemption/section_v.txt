sun really is ready to rise it is already so bright that it is almost

irrelevant if you can see the sun or not. When the whole world will be filled

with the brightness and glory of God then I will know that messiah is

near

. Until then I will just have to wait.

Since in

every level of creation there are two Strange Loops

: o

ne that takes one up and the other that takes one down to

the lower level [like the double helix of the DNA],

thus,

to come to the redemption one needs to find the Strange

Loop for the present level. But the present level consists of ten sephirot.

For

instance

,

t

he religious level has this strange loop

that

t

he more you get into it the more you find it implies

Jesus, but Jesus in the

New

Testament said

things

contradictory

to

the

Torah, at least on the face of it. But then again, he said

keep the whole Torah with exactitude. This works for all saints also. Like

getting involved with the Gra or Rabbi Nachman will

inevitably

lead to self-contradictions. This may seem to lead in

circles but in fact they

lead

to the next

higher level.
