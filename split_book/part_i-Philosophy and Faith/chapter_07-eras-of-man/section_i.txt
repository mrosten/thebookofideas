Chapter 7 – Eras of Man

“Not only the body, but also the soul whose habits, tempers,

opinions, desires, pleasures, fears never remain the same… and this is equally

true of knowledge… not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay… but

each of them individually experiences a like change.”

-Plato Symposium

MANKIND

PROGRESSED DOWNWARD THROUGH TIME. UNTIL JESUS WAS HIT AT THE ORIGIN. Then we

came out to the other side continuing in the same direction but now progressing

towards the light instead of away.

·

“At the

time of dusk there will be light.” The Zohar explained that this refers to the

272 years before the 6th millennium of the Hebrew calendar which comes out to

be the year 1968.

·

During

the 6th 1000-year period there was a flow on the level of Foundation which is

from 1240 until 2240. (3760 B.C. is the beginning of the 1st thousand.) This

would explain the flow of wisdom since then. And the Rambam's saying in the

letter to Yemen that prophesy would start then.

·

This is leading

up to the 7th thousand-year

period starting 2240. This is similar to the 1

st

thousand were to

draw from the previous “Sabbath” on thousand years while our period is to draw

from the coming thousand-year period.

•

Every

hundred years is a blessing in a different field as a part of the process of

the redemption of mankind.
