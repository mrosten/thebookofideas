spirit not just of the body is one reason Marx's material dialectics is

mistaken. Hegel at least had the intelligence to see the motivating force of

history is the quest of the Spirit for freedom [the name 63] but I believe that

The Baal Shem Tov Quoted Rav Saadiyah Gaon as saying, “It is

proper for a person to desire all physical things for from thence he will come

to desire Torah and the service of God.” This goes along with the Rambam in

Moreh Nevuchim that one who is feeling down should sit among the “Lovely forms”

and listen to music. [This gave some people at the beginning of the movement of

Chasidut to be somewhat promiscuous.] But this is clearly the idea of serving

God by everything since there is nothing besides God and everything is God, and

there is no evil in the world at all.
