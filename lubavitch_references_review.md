## Reference 1: `part_i_philosophy/chapter_08/section_i.md`
**Context:** List of failed Messianic movements  
**Tone:** Critical/sarcastic

### Original:
> Then, we got an assortment of saints that tried to bring the Geulah themselves and all failed. **Then, Chabad got into the Messiah business and in fact made a lot of money doing so.**

### Proposed Change:
> Then, we got an assortment of saints that tried to bring the Geulah themselves and all failed. **Then, some groups commercialized the Messianic expectation.**

**OR simply remove the sentence entirely:**
> Then, we got an assortment of saints that tried to bring the Geulah themselves and all failed.

## Reference 2: `part_i_philosophy/chapter_08/section_ii.md`
**Context:** Theological comparison between Besht and a later Chassidic school  
**Tone:** Academic but favorable to the figure

### Original:
> The Baal HaTanya (Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi) established a path which, while valid, differs significantly from early Chasidut. For instance, he deemphasized the central role of the "Rebbe," which the Baal Shem Tov (Besht) considered essential. Furthermore, the Besht taught that encountering physical beauty (such as a beautiful woman) is an opportunity to elevate that trait to its higher spiritual root—a practice the Baal HaTanya deemed inappropriate for the general populace. Their theological understanding of Divine Oneness also differs. For the Besht, the concept "There is nothing besides God" is literal, similar to the non-dualism of Shankara: everything is God, and there is nothing but His Infinite Light. For the Baal HaTanya, however, the world exists but is nullified before God "like a ray of light within the sun."

### Proposed Change:
> Certain later Chassidic schools established paths that, while valid, differ significantly from early Chasidut. For instance, some deemphasized the central role of the "Rebbe," which the Baal Shem Tov (Besht) considered essential. Furthermore, the Besht taught that encountering physical beauty (such as a beautiful woman) is an opportunity to elevate that trait to its higher spiritual root—a practice some later teachers deemed inappropriate for the general populace.

**Context:** List of major saints who had passed by 1840  
**Tone:** Neutral listing

### Original:
> ...by which time all the major saints of the Jewish people were gone, e.g., Rabbi Nachman, **the Baal Hatanya**, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzaira etc.

### Proposed Change:
> ...by which time all the major saints of the Jewish people were gone, e.g., Rabbi Nachman, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzaira, **and other Chassidic masters**.

**OR just remove:**

## Reference 4: `part_i_philosophy/chapter_04/section_vi.md`
**Context:** Discussion of meditation practices  
**Tone:** Neutral

### Original:
> Meditation is the main theme of **Rabbi Shneur Zalman** however it is mentioned by Rabbi Nachman as the calling to God from the depths of one's heart without voice or words.

### Proposed Change:
> Meditation is a central theme in **certain Chassidic works**, but Rabbi Nachman describes it as the calling to God from the depths of one's heart without voice or words.

---

## Reference 5: `part_i_philosophy/chapter_04/section_xv.md`
**Context:** Discussion about whether mitzvot are a goal in themselves  
**Tone:** Neutral/academic

### Original:
> Now there is a difference of opinion if the commandments are a goal in themselves. If we take **the Baal HaTanya's point of view**, then one way to resolve that Rashi, except to say that **the Baal HaTanya** must hold like the other Rishonim that explain that Gemara differently.

### Proposed Change:
> Now there is a difference of opinion if the commandments are a goal in themselves. If we take **a certain Chassidic point of view**, then one way to resolve that Rashi is to say that **this view** must align with the other Rishonim who explain that Gemara differently.

## Reference 6: `part_ii_halacha/chapter_11/section_i.md`
**Context:** Historical discussion of Gra vs Chassidim conflict  
**Tone:** Balanced/historical

### Original:
> The Chassidim, specifically **the Baal HaTanya**, argued they were saving the soul of the people.

### Proposed Change:
> The Chassidim argued they were saving the soul of the people.

---

## Reference 7: `part_iv_politics/chapter_01/section_v.md`
**Context:** Discussion about balancing freedom and order  
**Tone:** Praising the idea (not the person)

### Original:
> The answer is **the Baal Ha Tanya's idea** which is really from the kabbalah, but **the Baal Ha Tanya** shows how to use it. We need chaos and order together...

### Proposed Change:
> The answer comes from **a Kabbalistic principle** showing how to combine these forces. We need chaos and order together...

---

## Reference 8: `part_v_ideas/chapter_01/section_xix.md`
**Context:** Discussion about the origin of a Kabbalistic idea  
**Tone:** Searching for sources (somewhat favorable)

### Original (TWO references):
1. > This, it seems, is the root of **the Baal Hatanya's idea** of equating tohu [chaos] with the angles of the Divine Chariot.
2. > [I know there are many times when it seems **the Baal Hatanya** has no source in the Kabbalah but with patience, I have usually found some source for him...]

### Proposed Change:
1. > This, it seems, is the root of **a Chassidic teaching** equating tohu [chaos] with the angles of the Divine Chariot.
2. > **Remove the entire bracketed aside entirely** — it's a personal note that also praises the figure.

---

## Reference 9: `part_v_ideas/chapter_04/section_i.md`
**Context:** Comparison of teachings at different spiritual levels  
**Tone:** Favorable

### Original:
> While **the Baal HaTanya** provided the hints necessary to decipher these ideas in the world of *Atzilut* (Emanation), the professor on the way to Uman revealed...

### Proposed Change:
> While **certain Kabbalistic works** provide hints to decipher these ideas in the world of *Atzilut* (Emanation), a professor on the way to Uman revealed...

---

## Reference 10: `part_v_ideas/chapter_04/section_iv.md`
**Context:** Discussion of prayer vs Torah study (contains praise)  
**Tone:** Very favorable/praising

### Original:
> **The Baal HaTanya** says in the latter days things have changed, and I thought this sounds outrageous; however, when we reflect on it, I think we can see his point... As I always find that **things the Baal HaTanya says that sound the most outrageous usually have the most sense**.

### Proposed Change (removes both praise and name):
> **A later Chassidic teaching** says that in the latter days things have changed. When we reflect on it, we can see the point. For the root of the Torah is the Name 45 and the root of the mitzvot is 52 and so perhaps after a certain point in time the flow of light shifted from going down [the name 45] to going up, so that now prayer connects one to the flow of light.

## Reference 11: `part_vi_christianity/chapter_03/section_i.md`
**Context:** Discussion of soul origins for Jews and non-Jews  
**Tone:** Neutral/academic

### Original:
> **The Baal HaTanya** adds that the root of *Esau* (the West) originates in the World of *Tohu* (Chaos)—a realm higher and more intense than the World of *Tikun* (Correction) where Jacob resides.

### Proposed Change:
> **Chassidic teachings** add that the root of *Esau* (the West) originates in the World of *Tohu* (Chaos)—a realm higher and more intense than the World of *Tikun* (Correction) where Jacob resides.
