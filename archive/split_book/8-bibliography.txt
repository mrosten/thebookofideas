{When I read this book as a teenager I became aware of the need for a synthesis

of ideas as presented in this boo, but I needed many years to figure out what

that synthesis might be. I basically accepted the system of Spinoza and the

Torah, but needed Rabbi Nachman's books to give some hint of how to arrive at

the ideas in this book.]
