[TITLE: The World as Condensed Light]
<h4>The Substance of Matter</h4>
<p>In a literal sense, the existence of matter is the <strong>condensed light of God</strong>. The physical world is not a separate entity from the Divine, but rather the solidification of light that was drawn into the initial vessels of creation. Because of the "Breaking of the Vessels," this light is often hidden, making the world appear solid and opaque. However, every object you see is a garment for the Infinite Light.</p>

<strong>Preparation for Revelation</strong>
This world is not the destination; it is a preparation. The light that shines here is intended to purify our "vessels" (our character and intelligence) so they can eventually hold the far greater light of the Next World. Meditation and deeds do not "draw" this light down—they simply polish the vessel.
</div>

<h4>Strange Loops and Spiritual Levels</h4>
<p>The life-force, the spirit, and the soul exist on distinct levels of reality. These levels are not connected by a simple ladder, but by <strong>Strange Loops</strong>—hidden staircases that allow for the transition between dimensions. These transitions are not accessible by "tricks" or specific practices. God hates shortcuts; the Divine Light is a gift that may come once in a lifetime or stay for a season, but it can never be forced.</p>

<strong>The Kindness of God</strong>
The very reason for creation was a "lack" in the Kindness of God—the lack of an "Other" to receive that kindness. God created separate beings from Himself in order to reward them with the highest good: the eventual experience of being one with Him. Every challenge in the physical world is a step toward that reunification.
</div>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of all study and action is to make us holy—to love and fear God. We clean and polish our vessels, and if God chooses to pour in the water of His Presence, that is an act of supreme mercy.</p>
