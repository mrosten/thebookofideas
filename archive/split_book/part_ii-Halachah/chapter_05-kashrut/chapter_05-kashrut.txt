</div>

permitted. This gets rid of the need for a stamp of Kashrut on a lot of

Gemara in Avoda Zara says that the cheese of idolators is permitted and this is

is nothing to worry about.

biblically does need to be prepared in a kosher manner. Chicken also needs to

be prepared in a kosher manner, but it is only by rabbinical decree.
