<h4>The General Theory of Sephirot</h4>
<p>Einstein’s discovery that the curvature of space-time is proportional to the energy-stress tensor of matter finds its spiritual equivalent in the relationship between the *Circular* (*Igulim*) and *Straight* (*Yosher*) Sephirot. The the circular Sephirot represent the structural curvature of the spiritual universe, while the straight Sephirot represent the distribution and flux of Divine energy and momentum. These two tensors are fundamentally linked: the spiritual mass of a soul is determined by its alignment with the Commandments, which act as the "Laws of Continuity" for the flow of Light.</p>

                <p>The Circular Sephirot define the infinite, non-bounded parameters of the spiritual space. They represent the "Einstein Vector" of the universe—the background geometry that allows for the existence of any field or vessel.</p>

<h4>The Ten Equations of Existence</h4>
<p>There are ten equations that describe a fluid in four dimensions, just as there are ten Sephirot in each world. These equations dictate the density, pressure, and temperature of the spiritual "flux." By mapping the Ten Commandments to these fundamental equations of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, we see that the Moral Law is not an arbitrary set of rules, but the literal "Conservation Laws" of the universe's energy. Breaking a commandment is not just a sin; it is a violation of the spiritual law of entropy.</p>

<strong>The Schwarzschild Soul</strong>
The "Empty Space" (*Chalal*) created at the beginning of Emanation has its own Schwarzschild Radius. As God puts more energy into this space, the "Radius of Holiness" expands. At the center of this space lies a singularity of Infinite Light, which curves the entire spiritual universe around it.
