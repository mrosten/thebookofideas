<h4>The Regression of Holiness</h4>
<p>Success in various areas of life—children, health, wealth—can be viewed as the dependent variable in a complex multivariate equation. The commandments and holy actions are independent variables, each with its own "Coefficient of Effectiveness" (*k*). While every person has their own unique set of coefficients, the values remain relatively stable within a peer group. Using the *F-statistic* of faith, one can test whether a specific practice truly contributes to their overall salvation, allowing them to focus their time and energy on the variables that provide the highest spiritual return.</p>

                <h5>The Sum of Mitzvot</h5>
                <p>We assume that the effects of various Variable (Israel, Succah, Prayer) are additive. Doing one does not diminish the inherent value of the other; they accumulate in the soul’s ledger to produce a final result of peace and prosperity.</p>

                <h5>The Recursive Chain</h5>
                <p>Repentance (*Teshuvah*) is an exponential function. The first act of repentance brings inspiration, which increases awareness of God's greatness, requiring a second, deeper repentance. This creates a feedback loop: *Inspiration(next) = Inspiration(current) * k*. With each cycle, the quality of the light increases exponentially.</p>

<h4>The Peer Group Constant</h4>
<p>No saint or genius operates in a vacuum. The coefficients of a person's life are deeply influenced by the "Atmosphere" of their surroundings. Spinoza and Rabbi Moshe Chayim Luzzatto were both children of the philosophical environment of Amsterdam, which shaped their distinct yet mathematically similar approaches to the Infinite. By identifying the constants of our own environment—the spirit of our peer group—we can better understand the baseline potential from which our individual choices must start. True trust in God is the constant *D* that anchors the entire equation, regardless of the fluctuating independent variables.</p>

<strong>The Calculation of Happiness</strong>
Happiness is not a random occurrence; it is a calculation. By knowing the value of the statistics provided by the Likutei Moharan, a person can avoid years of wasted experimentation. They can identify the specific "Frequency of Joy" that resonates with their soul's current manifold and focus their energy on the variables that will most effectively integrate their vessels with the Light.
