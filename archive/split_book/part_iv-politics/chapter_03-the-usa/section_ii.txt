<h4>The Decay of Rulership</h4>
<p>In the modern era, the connection between rulership and wisdom has been severed. Power has shifted from a financial-political establishment to "intellectuals" who, in general, reject faith as their guide. Wisdom unconnected to God inevitably falls into the "evil side," where logic without heart becomes a poor guide for humanity. This shift has led to the destruction of the family and a general "digression backwards," where the obsession with money has replaced the search for a true life philosophy.</p>

                <h5>The Conformity Trap</h5>
                <p>Psychotherapy often acts as a tool for conformity, treating non-adjustment as a sin. By convincing potentially creative "super-people" that they are defective, this false science destroys the potential geniuses of our age. It is an escape from responsibility into the arms of a "magic helper."</p>

                <p>Biblical values recognize the biological and spiritual readiness of the individual. While modern society legalizes depravity among adults but legislates morality for the youth, a returned Biblical perspective would honor the intensity and holiness of love, the creation of life (through sex or even cloning), and the restoration of the family structure.</p>

<h4>The Mirror of New York</h4>
<p>Cities like New York represent the "root of the broken vessels." In an atmosphere of greed and anger, individuals may achieve saintliness, but spiritual "growth" remains nearly impossible. The erosion of the family, particularly the marginalization of the father, has caused a political chaos that parallels the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance. What could save the modern West is a reunification of Church and State—not a national church, but a local recognition of sacred law as the constitution of daily life.</p>

<strong>The Witness of the Churches</strong>
History shows that in the face of total tyranny (like the Nazi era), it was the churches—not the intellectuals or the universities—that stood up to the light-destroying force. Only those anchored in an unchanging Divine Law possess the courage to speak when the logic of the world dictates silence. As secularism loses its potency, religion will once again become the primary frequency through which mankind does either great good or great evil.
