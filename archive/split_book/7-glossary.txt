13 principles of faith

13 principles organized by the Rambam

that define Judaism. These principles are from the Talmud but the Rambam

organizes and clarifies them.

Adam

Kadmon

The region above Emanation. It is

associated with the crown on top of the yud of the divine name.



Baba Sali

Rabbi Israel Abuchatzeira, a Kabbalist

of the Twentieth century, great grand-son of Rabbi Shmuel Abuchatzeira, a

disciple of Rabbi Chayim Vital.

Banach

space

A  normed space that is complete.Any

normed space can be made into  a Banach space by completing it. Complete means

every fundamental sequence has a limit.It is like having an outside hull. A

linear space is called normed if  for every element there is associated a real

number [a distance more than or equal to zero] and it has these basic qualities

, even if

a

is complex:

The bars mean the distance.

Binomial

Breaking

The shattering of the

vessels is a functional concept in Kabbalah, the process of the creation and

ordering from higher to lower according to the ranks of the worlds, the godly

qualities that are called sephirot through turning over of the world in which

appeared in the higher worlds

Emanation

The highest of the four worlds. The

are from top to bottom Emanation Creation Formation and the Physical universe…

It is associated with the yud of the Divine Name.

Cantors diagonal argument. Take the

list of all the real numbers between 0 and 1. Go down the diagonal and change

every digit by one. Put a decimal place in front of the number you get. Now,

this number is different than the first one because it has a different first

digit. It is different than the second because it has a different second

digit,... So you found a real number between 0 and 1 not on the list of all

real numbers between 0 and 1!!!

Chasidishe.

Something related

to the movement within Orthodox Judaism called Chasidus.

Chaya

The fourth highest level of the soul.

Empty space. Because of the compassion

of God, He created the world. For he wanted to reveal his compassion, and there

was no creation on whom would he have show his compassion. Therefore he made

everything from the top of emanation to the center of the earth in for this

purpose.”(Lekutai Moharan)

Guide

The guide for the perplexed by the

Rambam.

Henkin

sentence

A sentence in mathematical logic which

asserts its own validity. In fact it is always valid.

Higgs

Field

It refers to a field that transfers

energy into matter.

Hilbert

space

In mathematics, Hilbert spaces (named after David Hilbert) allow

generalizing the methods of linear algebra and calculus from

(finite-dimensional) Euclidean vector spaces to spaces that may be

infinite-dimensional. Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in

mathematics and physics, typically as function spaces. Formally, a Hilbert

space is a vector space equipped with an inner product that defines a distance

function for which the space is a complete metric space. — Wikipedia

Kabbalah

The esoteric literature of the Torah.

Klipat

noga

The outer shell that is a mixture of

good and evil. It is associated withe tree of Knowledge of good and evil.

Klipot

The Outer Husks [The Evil Side]

Lekutai Moharan

The Collected Teachings of Rabbi

Nachman. The major book of Rabbi Nachman from Breslov. A great grandson of the

Baal Shem Tov HaKadosh.

Metric space

The distance between two points is

more than or equal to zero.This isn't the same as Banach space where distance

is associated with each single element.

Matrix.

An array of numbers each representing

the value of a variable, these variables can be algebraic but in this book I

mean the term to be applied to spiritual variables. And variable equations in

the creation.

Mitzvot.

The 613 commandments of the Old Testament.

Raisha delo isyada.

The head that is not known, i.e., the

highest point of the crown of emanation.

R-L-C Circuit. An electric circuit

that contains resistance, inductance, and a capacitor.

Rambam. Rabbi Moses Maimonides

Sephirot. Divine traits specified in

the verse To You O Lord is the Greatness and the Power and the Beauty and the

Victory and the Splendor, for all that is in the heavens and the earth, to you

is the rulership and the sovereignty to all to the top (Chronicles 1, chapter

29).

Sephiros deYosher. The straight sephirot.

When the world was created first God had to make spiritual space-time which

would be empty of his Infinite light so that there would be a place for

creation. Then his drew into it a ray of His light [the light of the name 52]

which after it had progressed a bit turned a right angle to circle the empty

space like an electron in a cyclotron indicating that first light was charged.

Then it went down a bit more and circled again in this manner until ten

circular sephirot were created. Then He drew the light of the name 45 into the

empty space and it came down and became in the form of a person. Now in those

higher worlds which are above Emanation there is no concept of vessels or form

and the use of these words is just to give us some vague idea of what was going

on up there.

Shemita opinion. The opinion of Rabbi

Issac of Akko and Rabbi Abulafia and other Kabbalists of the late middle Ages.

They say that the world goes in cycles of creation every 7000 years and that

this is the fourth of such cycles. If you add to that the other opinion of

rabbi Issac of Akko the each day of these cycles is a day of God which is 1000

of our years you get the age of the world to be about ten billion years.

Schwarzschild Radius. The region of a

black hole from which no light can escape.

Teffilin. Phylacteries

Tensor. A tool to measure mass-energy,

energy density and momentum at any point in space time

The Alter From Slobodka. One of the

Sages of the Musar Movement

The Shemita opinion. That this 7000

year period is just one of several that came before which is the opinion of R.

Issac from Akko,  Rabbi Abulafia etc., this was used by the Igeret Israel to

explain dinosaurs. But Breslovers think Rabbi Nachman didn't hold from this,

but I think Rabbi Nachman was objecting to another

shemita

opinion that

each 450 years in our time represents a different sepherah which some

thinkers held from, but not the Reshash, for he divides the years into cycles of

10, so to him each 100 years is a complete cycle, however the Rabbi Chayim Ben

Atar seems to have held from the seven seven option since he divides a persons

life into cycles of seven years seven years etc.

Somehow I remember the Rashash going

according to the shemita for the eons of the world.

Super Numbers. Numbers that must exist

if we add a sixth axiom to TNT, i.e., that it is not true that for all “a” (0+a)

= a. It turns out with this that we have one axiom that says all natural

numbers have a certain property and another which says there are numbers which

do have it. Thus we have a number/s that if you add a zero to them come out

different.

Tikunim of Rabbi Moshe Chayim

Lutzato.A book by Rabbi Lutzato similar to the Tikunai HaZohar of Rabbi Shimon

Bar Yochai.

Torah. The Five Books of Moses and the

Oral Law which was also handed down to Moses at Mount Sinai.

TNT.TypographicalNumber Theory.

Tzadikim. Jewish saints

Yidishkeit. Orthodox Judaism

Yechida. The highest level of the five

levels of the soul.

Yud. The tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet

Zohar. The major work of Kabbalah by

Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai.
