THE SONG OF

PHILOSOPHY

[1] The purpose of the creation of the

world is the revelation of the oneness of God. This is accomplished by the

system imbedded in the nature of the world, "trait for trait" . (By

the rewarding of good and truth and punishment of evil is revealed the oneness

of God.) This happens on every level or in every society, in every level of

existence. This is called the 'sifting' out of the bad and bringing up the good

to be included in the oneness of God. The idea of the creation of man is for

someone for God to do good to. For there was a basic lack in the divine traits

before the world was created. That lack was not in the traits themselves but in

royalty of the infinite one i.e. in the revelation of the traits. So God had to

create man to have someone to do well too. And the highest good are God

himself. But how can man have any connection with God himself? So God created

free-will so man could chose God. (This by choosing good from evil.) And thus

have a connection with God. Based on his own deeds and words and thoughts and

desire, not based on a free hand out which is in itself on the level of royalty

which needs to receive and that was the problem in the first place. But now man

has united royalty with the higher trait of giving by choosing God and not

needing a free-handout for his reward of the light of God by his merits. This

is based on the Ramchal, the beginning of the Eitz Chayim and the Lekutei

Moharan, but with a bit of integration. The idea is that God fills all worlds

and surrounds all worlds so one must unite the sparks of holiness in everything

with the infinite presence of God himself by choosing God in everything he does

says or thinks or desires and thus uniting himself and all creation with God.

When one is united with God than he can too create Godliness and this is the

first commandment in the Torah of being fruitful and to multiply, and children

and ideas, and music. [But why wasn't man created in a way that he could

receive good without doing good? Perhaps in another universe this is the case,

but here it seems we were to be like God in the way of choosing. Perhaps there

are infinite universes and this is the universe of choise.In other universes

there may be other traits.]

[2] The trait of "the measure that

one gives is the measure he receives" is the "sifting" out of

the bad and bringing up the good to be included in the oneness of God. But from

this deterministic principle results infinite chaos depending on every slight

variation in events. The end result of good being rewarded doesn't happen until

the next world where the oneness of God is revealed. How the chaos here results

in the oneness there is not known in detail. But the sages said that the good

suffer in this world the punishment for their sin's which they have done in

this life time or in previous life times, so that when they get to the next

world they can receive the undiluted light of God with their loved ones.

[3] The idea of the creation of man is

for someone for God to do good to. "Because of the compassion of God, He

created the world. For he wanted to reveal His compassion, and there was no

creation, on whom would He have to show his compassion. Therefore he made

everything from the top of emanation to the centre of the earth for this

purpose" (-Lekutai Moharan) for there was a basic lack in the Divine

traits before the world was created, the lack of the revelation of their unity.

[I.e. As Hegel said that each trait implies its opposite.] There was a

different lack in the perfection of each trait in itself which was that as long

as is hasn't been used, it is lacking the quality of being used. (Perhaps other

universes were created in order to fill other lacks?) [This assumes the Divine

traits weren't creations, but essential aspects of God, like Goodness and

Wisdom.] To correct these two lacks were created the world of the circular

sepherot and the world of the straight sepherot. So God had to create man (who

includes in himself all the higher sepherot) in order to have someone to do

good to. And the highest good is God himself.

But this idea seems to be different from

the idea of revelation of the oneness of God.

[4] How can man have any connection with

God himself? God therefore created freewill so man could choose God (this by

choosing good from evil) and thus have a connection with God based on his own

deeds and words and thoughts and desire, not based on a free handout which is

in itself on the level of royalty which needs to receive and that was the

problem in the first place. But now men has united royalty with the higher

trait of giving by choosing God and not needing a free-handout for his reward

of the light of the light of God are by his own merits. This is based on the

Ramchal, the beginning of the Eitz Chayim and the Lekutei Moharan, but with a

bit of integration.but then why not make man in a way he could receive infinite

good while being finite?This probably relatesto the fact that mankind is not

really created. Only God exists since he is existence in itself and man only

exists in as much as that divine existence includes him and sustains the

illusion of sepatness.But when one choosses God the illusion disaoiiears.

[5] The idea is that God fills all worlds

and surrounds all worlds and so one must unite the sparks of holiness in

everything with the infinite presence of God Himself by choosing God in

everything he does says or thinks or desires and thus uniting himself and all

creation with God. When one is united with God then he too can create Godliness

and this is the first commandment in the Torah of being fruitful and to

multiply, in children and ideas, and music.

[6] Pleasure is on the level of the tree

of knowledge of good and evil and therefore not good or bad in itself but

dependent on what one uses it for. If one brings up the sparks of holiness in

that pleasure into holiness, he himself goes up and the evil falls. Just saying

a blessing has nothing to do with this. It depends a lot on how he raises the

children. If it's food it depends on what one does with the energy. Pleasure

for the sake of pleasure remains on the original level and it falls into evil

and becomes evil itself. Pleasure however for the sake of God and done with

attachment to God is like a sacrifice, and is on a very holy level.

[7] One problem with Spinoza is he is

totally deterministic and doesn't incorporate the uncertainty principle in his

philosophy or his idea of the personality. However the idea of a mathematical

approach to philosophy and to personality is good, but not the Euclidian

approach, rather an approach based on Kabbalah and Non-Euclidian geometry

-because no one personality consists of straight lines rather curved

relativistic space and time. Rabbi Nachman has already mentioned this (Lekutai

Moharan Vol.1, Chap.49) but it still needs to be developed. Anyway Spinoza's

approach which is consistent has to be incomplete as all formal systems are.

[8] Free thought is important, for ideas

can't flow in a constricted vessel. But logic (in it's purest form) limits free

thought. Similarly Revelation also limits free thought, for there are things

beyond the comprehension of the mind that only revelation can reveal. Reason

and revelation are the two outer vessels that contain free thought

corresponding to Chaya and Yechida, the two outer fields surrounding and

protecting a person. Logic and the heart must work together but when there is a

disagreement, then one of them is wrong. In that case reason reigns in the

physical universe and intuition reigns in the spiritual universe. The dichotomy

of universities and religion (reason and revelation) is the divergence between

chaos and correction, and the goal is to bring the light of chaos into the

vessels of correction. Rabbi Nachman and the Rambam disagreed whether logic is

subjected to revelation or vice-versa, but in fact there is no disagreement.

Each has its own area where is qualified to judge.

[9] "Things of the spirit can be

revealed only by the spirit."   However, since there is nothing but God

and He permeates and is unified with the physical and spiritual universe so

God's presence in the physical universe is subject to logical proof which is

what Spinoza does. But he can't go beyond that into the spiritual realm which

works with mathematical principles but isn't subject to proof. That is the

result of the original condensing in which God removed the revelation and proof

of his presence from the empty space and only as we progress through time does

God reveal his presence and proof of his Presence one level at a time, as Rabbi

Nachman comments on the empty space and relates levels of revelation to the

outer makifim (field's) in which one level at a time enters humanity. So at

least Spinoza got the first step.

[10] "It takes many years of sifting

through false teachers to find a wise one. Don't be so fast to give up the wise

teachers of history for they have been sifted from millions of false ones and

their teachings have stood the test of the ages."-Greenfield. The Bible

the Sutras, the Talmud, Reason and Science may seem to contradict but in fact

each sees a different aspect of and points to the same truth. Each were digging

up the building blocks of the final structure. (Not to say that the structure

is ever finished) Some people are content to poke around the stones, and others

to try to knock down someone else's stone I think it is wiser to assemble them

into one great building and then to ride the elevator to the top to see

further.

[11] Rabbi Isaac Luria says that the

generations from Adam to Noah were evil and so were reborn at the time of the

flood to receive their punishment, in this world. Similarly the generations

before the dispersion and the tower of Babylon. Similarly the generations

before the destruction of the first Temple. And similarly the generations

before the Holocaust.

[12] The contradiction between absolute

knowledge and free-will is that God knows what one will choose not just from

the future but from now (I.e. not just because He knows the future). This

problem I once wanted to answer thus: One can choose what he wants, but God

knows what he will choose. The problem with this answer is the truth value of

that knowledge. This is really the sea battle problem. Take a look at these two

statements: There will be a sea battle tomorrow. There will not be a sea battle

tomorrow. Clearly one is right and the other wrong. If we say the past is

unchangeable the truth of one of these statements is unchangeable.

Now we can say the past is changeable and

get out of all these problems.

or we can say time is a loop and there is

no past. It is future. And thus the past is changeable in the next time cycle.

Or we can go with probabilities i.e. that everything is simply probability

waves.ie that everything is at present neither true nor false but only

probability.

This is not the same as quantum mechanics

which says things are probability waves until they are resolved into one thing

or the other.

But can this resolution go backwards?

Take matter or energy and unreslove it into waves. Of course. But then can we

take a present wave and unresolve it in the past into matter? If time is

reversible then yes. That leads me to think that in fact everything has an

absolute true or false value right now. And that the possibility now of a true

statement about the future changing its value implies a

Meta time [strange loop again]. And in

fact who says present is like past or future. Are not the past and future

literally non existent right now? And in fact all time is one predicate used by

physicists to describe things. But in Aristotle we find ten predicates. Of

course physicists don�t ignore them but we simply don't know what place

in reality most of them have . But they may have a place.

[13] Ideas are wave functions that have

all the characteristics of a quantum wave. [This includes the property of the

probability wave that travels with the idea. Thus with any idea one needs to

evaluate the probability that goes with it.] That's why it's important not to

think about your enemies badly so that yours and their wave function doesn't

mutually interfere and just darkness is left. Don't send your waves in that

direction at all, for their waves can't bother yours at all unless you do.

[14] The uncertainty principle applies to

all aspects of life and is the root of free will. An example is the conflict

between freedom of thought (thinking for yourself) and listening to the wise.

We find in the Torah itself this conflict, for even though we are supposed to

listen to the Sanhedrin, still there is a whole section of the Torah which

describes the types of sacrifice which must be brought when the Sanhedrin makes

a mistake. And the Sages say that if one knew they were wrong, yet still acted

on their opinion, he is responsible for his own actions.

[15] Ideas rotating around a common axis

will give off its rest energy and energy of motion in the form of idea waves.

That is the power the works of philosophy of Spinoza who takes a few basic

axioms and revolves them around each other until a whole work evolves out of it

which represents the energy of motion for after Spinoza was done, the idea's

implications of the axioms were fixed in idea space. However, the rest energy

continues to affect a larger circumference of people.

[16] The book Madragas HaAdam [The Level

of Man] created a vast mass movements but that movement disappeared in one

generation because it was built on one idea alone -absolute trust in God. That

is a great idea but doesn't give off much energy since it rotates on its own

axis, not around another major idea. That is the same problem with Rav Shick's

books based only on the principle that nothing exists besides God which is also

good but again nothing comes of it because it is only one axiom. (Most Christian

books I've seen have the same problem except for Thomas Aquinas, who basically

does the same thing as Spinoza.) Rabbi Nachman creates in every individual

chapter a revolving system, and all the systems revolve around a common set of

basic axioms. I believe that the Bible represents one revolving system (on one

axis God, and the basic 13 axioms of faith) and that is the reason for their

power. [Rabbi Nachman says a person should have three points, the teacher, his

friend, and himself.]

God created the world based on two

principles, chaos and order, which stem from the Divine names, 63 and 45. The

purpose of creation is to integrate them and bring them up to the name 72.

[17] The will to truth is to understand

something not based on any formula. It is examination by a specific formula

which has no bearing on the idea itself. It is examination from a different

viewpoint than that of the idea's maker and cannot do (accomplish) anything. It

is insensitivity to the idea. It is lack of understanding. [For example] to

examine myself from an entirely psychological and rational point of view is not

to understand myself.

[18] a) Assuming that a persons essence

is always good and that he can always choose what course of action he will

take, then the closer he gets to his soul, the more the soul will control his

will. And the more control the soul will have over the will.

b) But true thinkers think with

concepts and ideas with no root either in self or words or in logic. Pure

thinking is just a free interplay of concepts between the mind and the soul

with only intuition used to choose the good from the bad. If the ideas truly

come from the soul then they will eventually fit into the world of logic either

by the one who though it. Or the idea will die until another time to be given

birth by another mind. Ideas in this form are truly logical and not just

rational.

c) Logical thinking results in a creation

of value or of no value depending on the path of the logic taken by the mind.

Many paths may seem logical to the mind with only one resulting in some valid

result. To find that path one needs the help of the soul.

[19] Zeno's proof that there is no motion

is that, before an object can go any distance it has to go half that distance.

And before it can go that much it has to go a half of the last amount. Thus by

an infinite progression it is impossible to move since the object always has to

travel an infinitesimal amount and infinitesimal amounts can't add up since you

need an infinite amount of them to add up to anything.

It has seemed to me in general to

answer Zen's paradox to say that space is quantized. Just like there is no time

below Plank time, there is no space past a certain point. However Calculus

derives motion by reducing the distance of the motion down to an infinitely

small amount and by this it derives the true equations of motion. So apparently

there is a reality to an infinitesimal amount in the real world?

[20] We would think numbers are

descriptions [predicates] of things and therefore not real in themselves. But

tensors are also just the coefficients in front of a vector and are the most

real of things since they are the invariant quantities that define basic

physical reality.

So there is reason to believe the

Pythagoreans got it right.

But we assume there is some soul or

essence to people since they behave in certain ways i.e. they talk and walk

etc. numbers also behave in different and very unique ways. Like the derivative

of e is e. no other number does that etc. so it would be reasonable to say

numbers also have a soul or essence, not that they themselves are the souls of

everything else. But it could be that since the kabalah says numbers are in

royalty of emanation that they are the soul of all physical things but that

they themselves have a soul of some higher essence and a soul of a inner

essence.

[21] in torah and Christian thought there

is an absolute right and wrong. But does this define the meaning of our lives?

i saw once in the talks of a certain scholar that every person has a particular

destiny and meaning of his life.. But now the question is how does one discover

the meaning of his life. There is no question to me that this was the main

cause of the baal teshuva movement in America. But does following torah values

in fact provide us with meaning? This can only be done by living our lives and

making the best choices we can and hope that in this way the meaning and

purpose will become clear. [This is not like existentialism in which there is

no absolute right and wrong. here we have right and wrong but meaning and

purpose for each individual differs. possibly right and wrong is a means to

come to meaning — or the opposite.

[MR2]

[20 Continued] So really we could have infinite levels

of existence. I.e. existence itself may not be one thing. There could be

infinite levels. And all these levels may be right here and now, not just in

other universes. For instance math may be a sub level and below that there may

be another level and so on.. Similarly there may be higher levels of existence

of which we here are the cause.

[MR2]

So when we say there is a first cause of

existence, we may just be referring to the first starting level that precedes

the physical universe by many levels. The kabalah perhaps hints to this when it

talks about the previous shemita cycles of 7000 years each. [and each on is a

day of Hashem which is thousand years.]

[21] Aristotle mentions some people that

thought proof could be circular. He doesn't say how this works, but it is

supposed to answer the problem of limiting the number of causes. I think the

idea is thus:

The problem with cause and effect is that

it is linear. Who says existence is linear? In fact in Physics we find all

quantities that are linear have circular parallels.[matter -inertia, velocity

angular velocity etc.]

So perhaps for any object to existence

you need a bunch of causes to converge in one place. Maybe you need two causes

or three or an infinite number of causes like the points on a circle. [This

would correspond to the idea in Aristotle of an infinite number of principles

in his metaphysics]

So from this we can understand that every

bit of matter is the sum of a convergent series. [the probability wave which is

a sum[a Fourier series] has to converge.] of course there are different types

of convergence so perhaps and electron is only partially convergent

At any rate this reminds me of what a

student at Hebrew university told me once in a conversation about how he was

working on an idea of an electron being a singularity and I mentioned to him

that in math there are a whole bunch of types of singularities. The one

physicists refer to is only the first type. But this is the opposite of the

idea here of an electron being a convergent series.

[22] A problem with cause and effect is

that nothing is caused and complete. Everything is a probability wave. Anything

may be found anywhere in the universe or may simply become a light beam at any

time. So cause and effect is really incremental.

[23] The proof of Aristotle is two fold.

First things need to be potential then actual. Proof is that both need a first

cause to made things possibly exist and the actually exist. But here too we

have Zeno's paradox. So you have to say the causes can be incremental. For just

like motion could not exist unless there is incremental motion so existence

could not exist unless there is incremental existence. But what is the bridge

between incremental or infinitesimal existence and actual existence? For clearly

infinitesimals can't add up. And an infinite number of points on a line still

don�t make a continuous line. So there has to be some process bridging

between infinitesimal and finite. That is integration in mathematics. But what

is in the physical realm?
