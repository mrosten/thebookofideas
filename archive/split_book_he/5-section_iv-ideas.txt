Ideas in Kabbalah - The Song of the Soul

Introduction

Science

and Kabbalah are two distinct fields with apparently no relationship between

them. However here is my intention to show how each can illuminate the other as

long as each keeps to its respective parameters.

Mathematics

is the lowest

sepherah

of the spiritual world and the highest of the

physical, as Rabbi Luria says “the essence of numbers is in the sepherah of

Royalty”, so its’ laws govern both disciplines. Rabbi Issac Luria uses a

physical model to describe the spiritual reality (as per the Eitz Chayim).

In this

section I attempt to show the mathematical principles of this reality. Further,

as physics needs mathematical models to clarify itself, so the spiritual world

needs physical models to make clear its meaning. These I also will attempt to

show but bear in mind these are different worlds-- parallel but different, and

each lower world provides a model for what is above it and is like a reflection

in a pond. I think that every mathematical model has a corresponding spiritual

and a corresponding physical reality. Now

know

,

many will object that the formalist philosophy of mathematics claims that math

only deals with abstract symbols that may or may not have a relation to

reality. But this simply isn't true. Reality itself seems to be based on math,

and mathematicians know this. They use the theory of numbers as an aid to gain

knowledge about formal systems, and thus they show that in truth they believe

that numbers are actually a part of reality.

Four

types of flux (or Divine light) flow into the spiritual empty space: The Divine

names

72, 63, 45, 52

, i.e., gravitational, strong, weak, and

electro-magnetic.

·

The four

worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation and Action correspond to the four

types of space: metric space, normed space, Banach space, and Hilbert space -

where for each different types of operations are valid.

[The Ari

is clear that in AK even ideas of spiritual space don't apply so he is

apparently talking about a spiritual space where the concept of distance

dissolves — Isn't that Tensor space?]

In

general, the Kabbalah seems to deal only with totally arithmetic operations

[gematriot], except it hints to the other types of space only occasionally,

e.g., when the Ramak brings down that:

é

2

+ +

ä

2

å

2

+

ä

2

= 186 =

place [makom]

which

indicates that this is a 4-d place, and that a norm comes out to be the square

root of 186... The 5 forms (partzufim) have their origin in the 5 flows from

the name 72, 63, 45, 52, which are Gravitational, Strong, Weak,

Magnetism-Electricity.

·

The

relationship between the circular sephirot and the straight ones is that the

10-component curvature tensor of the circular sephirot is proportional to the

10-component energy-stress tensor of the straight ones.

(The Eitz

Chayim seems clear that the basic existence of vessels, or what we call ‘matter’

is in the straight sephirot, and matter is best represented by the

energy-stress tensor).

The

constant of proportionality should be decided in a way that the normal 613

commandments for Jews and 7 commandments for the children of Noah should be

reproduced under normal circumstances of weak fields and small velocities

[i.e., that these basic laws of human conduct are invariable in all frames of

reference and it is possible to understand their application in all situations

if we can know the constants and exact formula, for, as of now I understand

that the laws of the Torah are eternal and unchanging yet their application is

unknown in many circumstances.]

The 10

components of the energy-stress tensor in the spiritual

realm

which

describe the distribution and flux of energy and linear momentum of

every sepherah or soul. This tensor follows the four laws of continuity which

are from the four letters of the Ineffable Name. The ten components of the

Einstein tensor (the rearrangement of the Ricci tensor) which deals with the

curvature of spiritual and physical space-time is the source of the

gravitational field.

The

energy stress tensor describes the 10 straight sephirot and the Einstein vector

is the 10 circular sephirot - Einstein figured out that they must be

proportional - I'm just saying the same thing for the sephirot like he said for

the vectors.

What this

means is that the spiritual powers of the commandments and the ten statements

as they condense into the physical realm become the energy stress tensor and

the Einstein vector tensor. [That is, the commandments are a measure of the

spiritual mass-energy (vessels and light) energy density and momentum of a

person], this involves an approach to the sephirot different than the regular

one, for here we are saying that the first 9 describe the components of the 3-d

tensor which traditionally would be just 6 sephirot.

Thus,

there are twenty amino acids which correspond to the twenty symbols of TNT

which correspond to the twenty components of the curvature of four dimensional

space, which correspond to the twenty components of the Einstein tensor and the

mass energy tensor that have to be proportional according to Einstein. [See

page 533 of Gödel, Escher, Bach].

Also,

there are ten equations that describe a fluid in four and ten quantities that

characterize that fluid corresponding to the ten sephirot of yosher and the ten

of igulim...The correlations thus;

1)

I am the Lord p = p (n, s)

2)

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy

God in vain, T = (n, s)

3)

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy, d

r=[r+

p]/n+nTds

the first law of thermodynamics [conservation of energy]

4)

·

u = -1

The

proportionality of the ten components of the Einstein tensor and the energy

stress tensor are parallel to the ten sephirot of the point of wisdom and the

ten of the point of understanding. However, there must be another ten-component

tensor that we are not aware of since there is also the ten sephirot of the

point of the crown which hasn't been accounted for. [I am assuming the 6 sephirot

of Zeir and the one of

malchut

relate to just the physical manifestation

of the higher points.]

The

question, however, is how is the breaking of the vessels reflected in the

physical realm? Is this the law of uncertainty that will be rectified after the

revival of the dead? How can a law that is so much in the fabric of the

universe be rectified? Don't we correct the breaking of the vessels every day

by prayer, and certainly the law of uncertainty doesn't change from day to day.

The answer apparently is that this law also has its roots in the circular sephirot

which will be united with the straight ones at the revival, but not change

their essential character.

·

A more

traditional approach would be that in 5-d spiritual space the three dimensions

are 6 lower sephirot as per the directions of Rabbi Luria for the lulav, (we'll

call the entire kindness and anti-kindness (power) direction just by k, beauty

and anti-beauty (foundation) by b, and victory and anti-victory (splendor) by

v. Then crown and anti-crown (royalty) we'll call c, and Wisdom and

understanding by w. Thus, the stress tensor is:

T = itk + jtb + ktv + ltw + mtc. (This

involves more than ten components).

·

The Empty

space should be limited to some dimensions, not infinite dimensional, and the

straight light coming down should be one dimension less. The reason I think it

has to be finite dimensional is so that a description of it will be necessary

and sufficient. Only to God is the near the same as the far but as we describe

distances and time even in a spiritual way the description has to be confined

to some limited number of dimensions to have any meaning.

·

The empty

space rotates on its axis and revolves around a center point and one outside

itself and this produces the flux's that enters it. The rotation causes it to

be in the form of an ellipsoid i.e.

X

2

/ a

2

+ y

2

/ b

2

+ z

2

/ c

2

= 1.

·

The empty

space has the quality of hiding the light of God, and every level of hiding

hides the previous level so one doesn't know that God is hidden and thinks he

is close to God. And that level is hidden by another level in a continuous

progression. Each level is a different level of darkness. The character of

God's Infinite Light is that as it progresses further down through the darkness

it illuminates one more level of hiding. Every higher level of light that comes

into the world defuses a greater degree of darkness.

·

Since the empty space is rotating it

must have an ergosphere.

·

The

singularity in the center of the empty space is connected to the light

surrounding the space through an outside dimension.

·

The ten

circular sephirot are actually energy waves emanating from the vibration of the

roof of the empty space. The dot in the middle also vibrates and gives off its

own circular sephirot. So actually Faith, Sexual purity etc., are actually

energy waves. Every individual gives them off by the degree he holds on to

every trait.

·

The area

under the singularity of the infinite light is negative time, to the right is

positive space, to the left negative space from where the worlds of negative

probabilities emerge. Imaginary space is the opposite side.

·

The

center of the empty space which is the singularity of the infinite light gives

off waves like a drop falling on a lake which are its circular sephirot as

opposed to the circular sephirot which enter the empty space from above.

·

What

makes the world line of the circular sephirot [the Igulim] tilt away from the

vertical is the speed they rotate through the empty space. Since they rotate at

speeds faster than light, they have horizontal world lines. The circular form

of those sephirot is due to the fact they are traveling in a time field which

causes them to bend, just like an electron traveling at an angle to a magnetic

field. (The straight sephirot are time-like [They travel slower than the speed

of the light, so the Eitz Chayim refers to them as if they were stationary

which only means that they are an inertial frame of reference) and the circular

sephirot are space-like.)

·

Since the

empty space is finite without boundaries, and in the opinion of the Ramchal it

refers to time and space one can travel indefinitely in one direction in time

as we are in fact doing and find ourselves at the beginning of time at the top

of the empty space.

[the regular wave

equation]

The

reason I am saying that it is a derivative is that the Eitz Chayim says at the

very beginning of his book that the division of the

sephirot

continues

indefinitely. (However, the Rashash seems to have a different opinion.)

Y is the

distance from the light to the top of the empty space.

(

T is the

tension of the empty space (?) is the density.)

If

f

is a regular mapping of a good deed on a surface of the soul or onto the

surface of the empty space, then for every point there is a coordinate patch

    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

a coordinate patch on S.

·

Resistance

in the higher sephirot of emanation is a characteristic of the vessels of the sephirot

without which they couldn't shine out their own light (they would still allow

the infinite light of God to radiate from within them, but with resistance they

form a R-L-C circuit, and they emanate their own unique frequency of light).

The frequency of the light coming into the empty space is infinite, and only

lessened by its coming into the circular sephirot.

·

<???>

Each

sephirah is a sphere only in its own dimension it's a hollow cylinder with

respect to the higher one, like a circle is only closed in flat-land but with

respect to the three dimensional world it is hollow. Thus, the sephirot are

closed with regard to observer in spiritual 4-d space but a long cylinder from

the aspect of 5-d space. The probability density of the vessel of each sephirah

varies inversely as the square of the distance from the center since density of

(x, y, z) = k / r

2

so M=

òòò

(x,y,z)dV = 4kr

unit

amot. The ability of the righteous like Bava Sali to see beyond the confines of

space is because they are spiritually raised to spiritual 5 space where they

can see space and time laid out before them as a map.

·<???>

The

surrounding lights of the sephirot (Chayah and Yechidah) are fields, not lights

per say. The light from understanding (Binah) is related to the electromagnetic

force, in that the

hashmal

outer covering of Zeir and Nukbah come from

it. Binah is composed of higher and lower levels, as the Ari goes into at great

length.

B=

0

(H+M) (B

is the entire induction field of Binah, Binah Ilaah (The higher Understanding)

is the magnetic field H, Tvunah is the density M). For the Chashmal

(electricity) to emanate from Binah, Binah has to be rotating in relation to

Zeir and Nukbah (the two sephirot of Beauty and Royalty)

·

The

simple explanation of the light that is left in the vessels as the main light

goes back up is that it is like light that shines on the surface of something

and the surface heats up because of the energy that got absorbed. The question

is what in the world is the second light that Rabbi Luria says is left there?!

(I would suggest that it refers to the photo-electric effect.)

·

The 22

Hebrew letters have numerical value, but they also represent functions.

Specifically,

the 10 letters which represent the 10 sephirot, t”vdyps t”rpB d”

g

b s”ma

are

representative of 10 functions, depending on what world you are in: In

Emanation of math they are the Gamma function, the Beta function, the Bessel

function, Fourier Integral, Legendre function, the error function, the

complementary error function, the sine integral, the cosine integral, Fresnel

function, Fresnel cosine function.

·

The

normal distribution coming from

sephiros deYosher

is the reason the

light of

nekudim

is found mainly in front of Adam Kadmon, but there is

some slight probability of the light being found elsewhere, and so we find some

light in the back of the light of .

·

It's

clear that the Vessels were broken because of there being too much energy

inside the vessel (so if there was let's say a lower sephirah's light it would

be o.k.). So, when before he says the vessels weren't fixed as one male and

female it would seem he means that if the vessels would have been fixed as one

there would have been strength to hold the light. However, why in the higher sephirot

weren't they broken? It would seem that this is because the light of the Crown

was made to hold its very intense light so the rest of the light couldn't break

it. They all have the same wavelength, when they are up there in the Crown, but

the lower light has a smaller amplitude, so the amplitudes combine but don't

break the vessel since its made for that wavelength. But the problem with this

is that shouldn't the vessel break at their own resonance frequency? Perhaps

the

nekudim

are spiritual neutrons that are absorbed into the vessels

and cause them to break apart by atomic fission. Its not that they break by the

force of the impact. The breaking of the vessels was a chain reaction. The

energy given off was (The mass of the sephirot)

(The

speed of the Infinite Light) ²

·

The

higher worlds of the Kabbalah are not higher in the conventional sense but rather

at a 90° angle to our 3D space. As the electrons (the letters of the alphabet)

flow through the sephirot an outer magnetic field is generated. It would seem

the physical universe is surrounded by Formation

outside, in terms of the

circular sephirot

(

in plain 3D terms) -- but there the world is

spiritual, and that “up” also means in one more direction up in terms of the

straight sephirot. In the middle of the empty space, it would seem there is a

singularity, the most inner point of the circular sephirot, for as they

progress towards the center, they become more physical until you get a type of

Higgs Field that transforms spiritual energy into physical. The Eitz Chayim is

all about the straight sephirot and doesn't deal with the circular ones which

are the spiritual root of non-Jews, and the fields of the physical universe.

·

The Schwarzschild

Radius of the empty space is:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

·

It seems

from this that as God puts more energy into the empty space the radius gets

bigger. The singularity of infinite light in the center of the empty space is

what causes it to be curved. The outer light surrounding the straight sephirot

is the magnetic field from the name 52 surrounding a current-bearing conductor

of the light of the name 45. The circular sephirot are rotating in an external

magnetic field and that is how they create the electric current of the straight

sephirot, as the sages said, “there is a sphere that circles around in the

world”.

(The

Circular sephirot are 3­D spheres rotating sideways into the 4

th

spiritual dimension). (Since they are accelerating, they give out gravitational

waves also, which also affects the straight sephirot. Obviously, the broken

vessels give out gravitational waves also as they fall and later rise). (The

straight sephirot have to be electric since they are straight and don't make a

complete circle like a magnetic field). This leaves us with figuring out how

the next 3 forces relate to the names 63 and 72 and this certainly seems to

imply that the straight lines of gravity are produced by some rotating outer

field of some higher force surrounding the 3 dimensions of the universe.

·

The

universe operates like a pentode

[11]

,

and this explains the reason for the grid between Emanation and Creation (the

suppressor grid) and between Creation and Formation (the screen grid) and

between Formation and the physical universe (the control grid) -- the main idea

is because the current is AC (i.e., reaching and not reaching as it explains at

length in the Eitz Chayim). You use a grid to make a change in the plate

current (the source of the light) by small changes in the grid potential that

is caused by mitzvot and good deeds. [There is one problem with this and that

is that the current shouldn't be affected by distance, so how can I explain the

fact that the Eitz Chayim says distance and resistance are factors.]

·

The wavelength of the light of each

sephirah is

·

When the

string of the vessel of the Crown is plucked, it emits a wave with harmonics.

The frequency of the crown is 10 times the frequency of Royalty. The problem

was that all the harmonics were above that of the Crown, so the lower vessels

broke. The correction was when the string of Royalty was plucked and the higher

sephirot were its harmonics, so the energy was less.

·

The

uncertainties of the world of

akudim

(the wave pattern of the

sepherot

,

literally “streaked”) come in mathematical wave form in probability space.

·

The

distance between the sephirah of the crown and wisdom is (2-1) (r) if r

is the radius of the empty space. (As you continue down you keep the same

order). (As the empty space expands and contracts the radius varies, so at one

period in time one might be able to rise from one level to the next easily since

there is just a small distance to go and at other periods in history or in

one's own life it might be very difficult). (As we progress toward the

singularity in the center, humanity goes from one level to the next very

quickly. I know many people have wondered why it took humanity such a long time

to make any slight bit of progress in the olden days while now it seems every

10 years, we enter into a new century. (And every century is 1000 years of the

old time). However, the expanding of the empty space caused a spiritual red

shift of the light as it came down to us. One of the reasons that the light

that we receive in the physical universe is much denser and more physical than

the spiritual light in the higher worlds is that the light has gone through the

whole empty space to reach us, and that empty space is expanding so there is a

red shift in the frequency of the light. So, this explains why to the Ari there

is a change is the essential nature of the light as it travels a distance in

the higher worlds.

·

The top

of the spiritual empty space is the top of the future light cone. The world

inside it is made of time-like directions. We are going down in it because from

the aspect of Einstein's equations (time is a negative coordinate) the right

side is positive space the left is negative space - where the particles of

negative probabilities emerge from. The bottom side of the singularity of the

infinite light is negative time:

    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

·

The

orientation of the sephirot is either right handed, left handed or zero spin.

Their position in regard to each other is as is stated in the Eitz Chayim,

however they also have spin. The Right hand Sephirot have right-hand spin, the

middle none, and the left have left-hand spin. Splendor and Eternity have half

integer spin and are thus subject to Fermi Statistics. Kindness and Power have

whole integer spin and are thus subject to Einstein-Bose Statistics. One result

of this is that any flow coming from the right-handed sephirot like kindness or

Wisdom will have integer-spin like Photons or in general any particles whose

exchange generates some interaction. This is a problem, for bosons carry all

the interactions -- so aren't there left-handed interactions from the sephirot

of power? The answer is that there are only four interactions, from the names

72 (right), 63 (left), 45 (right), 52 (left), and the four are always symmetric

until some Higgs field breaks the symmetry.

·

Since

Royalty and Beauty are rotating on their own axis, they emit wave radiation

from of the four types of waves (72, 63, 45, 52). Since Royalty rotates around Beauty

they consist of a closed system, and give off Name-72 waves, which involves a

loss of their energy of motion and rest energy. Therefore, they need to receive

more energy into order to keep up the oscillation. (If not, they just float

away as name 72 radiation waves.

·

The

singularity in the center of the empty space is a white hole not surrounded by

an event horizon, which spews out spiritual mass and energy, not subject to the

laws of spiritual physics. It has its own circular and straight sephirot

outside of it. Its surface is our four dimensional world. The inside I think is

a different type of continuation of the process of the evolving of the

spiritual worlds in the regular empty space.

·

Since the

whole universe is analytic it can be expanded into a Taylor series (that's why

one needs to get married i.e., in order to continue the series.) The circular sephirot

are analytic but the straight sephirot are not. But the bottom seven sephirot

of the generality of the worlds [all taken as one] are analytic because they

are like cylinders.

·

Sephirot

are a vector space since the operations of addition and multiplication apply to

them. Multiplication by the sephirot is what the

kabbalah

calls mating,

for addition is just adding two things [of the same essence] together, while

mating is applying the value of one thing to the value of another in order to

come out with a greater (or lesser) result.

·

The

circular sephirot are analytic since they have a derivative everywhere. I don't

know about the straight ones since even though they are called straight they

are formed like cylinders.

This is

the intent of the sages when they say, “there is no freedom except for Torah.”

With the first verse of the Torah, it is possible to show this even in the form

it is in in the Torah, for it can be put into Echelon form:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The

linearly independent solutions are related to one homogeneous differential

equation of order six. Apparently, that is the equation of the Creation.

The

torsion of the verse has to be more than zero which gives us a right-handed

system of sephirot since the vectors described are independent.

However,

the general system according to the Kabbalah is that the top row of the matrix

is the beginning letters of every word of the verse, the middle row of the

matrix is the middle letters, and the last row is the last letters of each

word. So, for example the first verse is a 3 times 7 matrix.

·

The

reason the world is 3 dimensional is that it is built by the Divine name 72

which consists of three letters for each name which are each orthogonal to each

other. [This is based on the verse “the world is built by kindness”. The name

72 corresponds to the Divine trait of Kindness.]

The

metric here is given by the divine name of the four letters:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The

Divine name, which indicates that God is the Force of forces is “God”, or

“Elohim”. The five letters of this name correspond to the five components of

the equation for the total force on any specific volume, oyhla = F(total) =

n cosTds. The basic three letters are the basic name

which is the basic equation with the dot after the

lamed

indicating the

dot product and the mistakes the word plural and thus indicates the sum of all

the forces which is the integral sign. In its inner essence this equation is

the divine name of the four letters

hvhy.

The

h

is the

ds, the small surface, the

y

is the tension, the

v

is the

normal to the surface and the first

h

is the

cos

of the angle between the tension and the normal to

the surface.

Now this

is the scheme of Creation as we can see on every levelfrom this diagram of the

the Genetic Code, the Godel Code together with the order of the higher worlds

and the

formula for the curvature of space -time.

The same

system of four levels corresponding to the four worlds emanation creation

formation physical which are the four letters of the Divine name.

The way

one levels corresponds to the next is by the strange spiral[Strange Loop in the

language of Godel Escher Bach]That is how we travel through the Spiritual to

Idea to will to the Godel Code to the Genetic Code etc from level of hiearchy

to other level.It may be possible from this to get some hint as to solve some

of the mysteries that are still unknown.EG it seems the fact that this

describes the amino acids only statistically is related to the fact that nature

on its most fundamental level can be described only by statistics.

·

The

musical notes on top of the letters in the Torah are indexes of integration for

Emanation. But, since each letter corresponds to a different type of function

depending on what world you are in, the significance of the notes for each

world isn't clear to me. (This idea of the same thing signifying different

things depending on what world you are in isn't my idea. A college professor

from Texas mentioned it to me concerning the Lekutai Moharan)

·

The

normal representation of the commandments is a square matrix (613 x 613).

tefilin

of tefilin + shabat of tefilin + tzitzit of tefilin + ……

shabat of

shabat+tefilin of Shabat + ...

Then,

after the correction the order switched, and you take the transpose of the

above matrix. So that tefilin becomes only tefilin, i.e.,

tefilin of tefilin

+ tefilin of Shabat + Tefilin of Tzitzit + …

This is

actually the opinion of Beit Shamai according to Rabbi Yochanan at the

beginning of Pesachim.

·

The

commandments of the Bible acting on a complex finite dimensional inner product

soul, can be represented by a triangular matrix relative to an orthonormal

basis of the soul. [The determinate of that matrix will give you the volume of

light it contains. Now, this explains why in some places in the Eitz Chayim the

higher worlds are represented as square and even after the revival of the dead

the order will be the transpose of the present order. While in other places the

order is like a triangle like this.

There are

ten empty spaces, and each is divisible into ten, which are divisible into ten

ad infinitum. Each one is on a different plane, i.e., the three dimensional

sphere is surrounded by a 4-D sphere which is surrounded etc. Each has its own

surrounding sephirot in its own dimension. For instance, our empty space is

surrounded by Royalty of the Infinite One which is surrounded etc. Like this:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

A = The

empty space.

b = Top

of the empty space, circular Royalty of the Infinite One.

c =

Square royalty of the Infinite One. This is what the Kabbalists of the Middle

Ages call the Royalty of the Infinite One. However, I haven't seen the Ari

mention it.

d =

Circular foundation.

e =

Square foundation. The square sephirot are the source of the linear sephirot in

the empty space. The lines coming down from the top to the center are the roots

of the sephirot in the shape of an Eagle.

The lines

of the left side are the root of the sephirot in the shape of a lion. The right

is the root of the Bull. The lines coming up to the center are the sephirot of

Adam Kadmon, the sephirot in the shape of a person, which is the general

subject of the Eitz Chayim. The time-axis is negative, so to get the regular

order we are used to you have to turn it upside down. This, it seems, is the

root of the Baal Hatanya's idea of equating

tohu

[chaos] with the angles

of the Divine Chariot.

The idea

of turning the whole thing over is Rabbi Nachman's of man ruling over the

angels.

[I know

there are many times when it seems the Baal Hatanya has no source in the

Kabbalah but with patience, I have usually found some source for him. For

instance, it bothered me a long time that he equated the higher Unification

with the higher knowledge. Now that has no way of working with the Drush HaDaat

at the end of the Eitz Chayim. Eventually, I discovered that the commentary on

the Rashash, the Shemen Sasson, says Drush HaDaat is only the generality of the

Emanation and in fact doesn't work with the specifics, and that the higher

Israel and Understanding are half of The Father and the

Mother

.]

The ten

traits of the five basic sephirot are bases for those sephirot. i.e., they are

linearly independent.

·

The Zohar

says there are nine palaces above the sephirot that are not light or spirit or

souls. They are, in the spiritual realm, the equivalent of the nine components

of the force-density tensor.

This is

because they are made, as the Zohar says, by the impulses of the nine lower sephirot

on the crown. [Even though I have not seen this anywhere, I suppose these nine “palaces”

are the eight white hairs of Arich, and the first

tikun

of the beard

which come to Zeir Anpin.]

Wisdom (= Txz k)

ty = Power (= Tyxi) +

These are

not the sephirot but the result of the sephirot hitting the crown. And they are

The

correspondence between the circular and straight sephirot is clearly the basis

of the lower world of logic and will, and then the physical creation as we can

see from the following diagram

It seems

and the entire

.

·

As we can see from this diagram

†

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Each

sepherah represents a different plane of existence. So, for example the world

of logic [the sepherah of wisdom] is one level of reality, while the world of

the light [the sepherah of the crown] is another level.

Neither

one is more nor less real than the other, just each one is different. So, the

fact that some people get a certain light by meditation doesn't cancel the

validity of the world of logic. The connection between each world is the

Strange

Loops

that exist in each one.

For

instance, “This sentence is false.” This explains why morality isn't rational,

for morality stems from the lower six sepherot [except for the bottom] and

can't claim to be rational — which is from the world of logic. The light inside

each one is circulating, so attachment to any sepherah takes one in a somewhat

circular path.

The

Strange

Loop

inside of morality is thus:

·

Kindness dictates giving with no limit.

·

Judgement indicates punishment without limit.

·

Each limits the other to come to Justice [the

middle sepherah-beauty], i.e., its’ two infinite sets that cancel to come to

the synthesis of giving only what you own yourself, and not to take from the

rich to give to the poor.

·

Each

sepherah has its own rules for people: the rules of the Torah come from Beauty,

the laws of the country one lives in come from Royalty. Thus, just because one

follows the laws of the Torah [Beauty] that does't mean one is permitted to transgress

the laws of one's country. And if one does so, Royalty itself takes revenge.

The rules

of Foundation are related to sexual purity.

The rules

of Wisdom are related to learning Wisdom and not making mistakes in the ten

subjects of wisdom: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Logic, Biology, Music,

Philosophy, Kabbalah [i.e., the three highest ones]. Of course, people that are

more associated with one sepherah particularly [or their root is there] must be

more careful than others in matters relating to that sepherah.

·

A person with

only a nefesh has a straight world line. A person with spirit has a second-order

curve as a world line. A person with neshamah [soul] has a third order curve. If

he has nefesh of the Neshamah, i.e., world line is Neil's parabola where he

reaches the Origin just once.unless his function is recurring.

The five

levels of the soul are a Neils Parabola, the Witch of Agnesi, the Folium of Descartes,

the Cissoid and the Strophoid.

If he has

one of the five levels of the Chaya also, his world line follows the pattern of

the five types of curves of the fourth order, the  Cochoids of Nicomedes, the

Limacon of Pascal, the Cardioid, the Cassinian Oval, or the Lemniscate.

Chapter 2   - Roots of Science

Introduction

Science

and Kabbalah are two distinct fields with apparently no relationship between

them. Yet Einstein wrote that the object of all science is to coordinate our

experiences and to bring them into a logical system. He also said that there is

no real qualitative difference between those sense perceptions which are common

to different individuals (and in that sense impersonal) and those which are

experienced by only one person. Those which are common to different people are

really no more factual than those which are experienced by one. Kabbalah

involves personal experience which however can be verified by its effects in

the inter-personal world.

It's my

hope that this section will coordinate experience (spiritual and scientific)

and bring them all into a logical system.

It is

also my hope to show how Science and Kabbalah can illuminate the other as long

as each keeps its respective parameters in mind. When either forgets it's

boundaries it usually does notoriously badly. Physics describes reality based

on models taken from every day experience and these models work. I am trying

here to find what the true inner model of Physics is by using the Kabbalah,

i.e., I'm trying to find the spiritual realities upon which the physical world

is based.

·

The two

kinds of circular and straight sephirot are the root of the uncertainty of the

continuum hypothesis (that Cantor hypothesized that there is no set that has a

cardinal number between

a

0

(the cardinal number of elements of the set of all natural

numbers) and “c” (the cardinal number of the set of all rational and irrational

numbers) where each kind of valid math can be built on either opposite

assumption.

·

The

circular sephirot have a base of p. In turn the root of that is the contradiction

of the emptiness of the empty space though it must have the presence of God in

it. (The emptiness is Godliness, but we can't find God there.)

·

Perhaps

gravity has a counterpart like the electric force with the magnetic force --

and that something could cause a red shift in gravity waves like gravity causes

for light waves. [In General Relativity, gravity is conservative, like the

electric force. I wonder about a possible counterpart like the magnetic force. At

any rate, since everything in creation seems to contain Strange Loops, I would

imagine that the universe does form a loop and though gravity doesn't form

loops on a small scale perhaps it does on a large scale. Perhaps this could

explain the fact that the galaxies don't fly apart. If gravity is in fact like

the electromagnetic force, if it would change over the course of time, you

would get its counterpart. Now any accelerating system like the earth and the

sun [or the galaxy] is changing over time, so perhaps this system is emitting

some other type of waves besides gravitational waves. Yet since the density of

the galaxy is so small, we just don't notice it.

·

The light

of the sephirot isn't all the same, but the light of 52 is a spiritual-electric

field and the light of 45 is a magnetic field and together they create a

spiritual electromagnetic wave by the oscillation of the name 52 at the top of

the empty space.

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

is an inverse square law

just like

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

because speed is a

measure of space-time like length is a measure of space. So, the force that

turns energy to matter is an inverse square force. (So, if c was a variable,

the less it would be, the more mass you would have, so c

2

takes the

place of r

2

in a higher realm. But what would come after that a

2

,

the acceleration of light? And after that, I guess, would be the change in the

acceleration with respect to time, and so for every dimension up you add.

·

Current

is described by a differential equation that has a solution only with a complex

number. Perhaps that is because mass has a complex part of itself as in

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

.

That is

the same part that can travel faster than light.

Mass that

is infinite can travel at the speed of light and that mass is

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

, i.e.,

the first

uncountable type of infinity that can be contained within some

limit, like

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

.

It is

probably obvious to most scientists

,

but since I

haven't seen this mentioned anywhere, I think it is proper to say this. The

inverse square laws are a result of the fact that the surface area of the

sphere is

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

, i.e., since the force

coming out of any object is diluted over the area of a sphere the further out

you go, gravity or the electromagnetic force must be reduced by a factor of r

2

.

Every

physical body has extension into imaginary space (not the fourth dimension, but

into space times 'I'). This makes every mass, even if in a random chaotic

shape, symmetrical. If you stop the vibrations at the nodes, you increase the

frequency which increases the energy. This particularly should apply to the

strings of which the atom is made. Also, to the galactic strings, so that at

places where the galaxies don't form there should be an increase of energy.

[Looking at this now I am not so sure for wasn't that the independent variable

idea with the electron i.e., how someone wanted to explain the uncertainty of

electron, and I seem to recall that was refuted experimentally. However, the

imaginary numbers do seem to pop up in the most common places like electric

current]

·

The order

of adding up the electrons to the chemical elements and the order of the

unification table and the order of the table for proving the equivalence of the

set of positive rational fractions with all natural numbers [Cantor's diagonal

method] and the way of doing certain continuous integrals like <???>

ò

(x

3

)(

e

x

)

is the same pattern of the parallel 45-degree lines through the

table:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The root

of this is the fact that at the beginning before the correction the order of

the worlds was horizontal, then it changed to vertical e.g., the mitzvah of

teffilin had all the other mitzvot in it, like Shabbat of tefillin, prayer of

tefillin etc. Then it was changed to take the tefillin of all the other mitzvot

and put them into tefillin so that tefillin is only tefillin, i.e., tefillin of

Shabbat, tefilin of prayer etc., this happened in all the world so the order of

all the worlds was switched. The sixteen levels of this GUT relate to the

sixteen components of the stress energy tensor (even though it reduces down to

ten components) which is related on the next parallel level of the Typo-genetic

Code by which each pair of ACGT codes for an amino acid, thus;

Tab

Each

level of the hierarchy of Creation is based on similar matrices. This is why

the diagonal functions keep showing up like the trace [for Cantor], the

determinant [for the volume of the universe], characteristic polynomials, the

relation between each level of creation is thus;

If A is

the matrix of the Genetic Code and B is that of the table of the elements, then

A = P

- 1

BP. Now

we have to find Matrix P to get the connection, and P

-1

represent

the two Strange Loops on every level like the two ladders of the double helix

of the DNA.

Now we

can learn from this that if f[B]=f[A], then f[T] = f[T]s. So, the function that

works between levels can also work on the same level on the inverse base of

that level. The question is what operations does this describe for TNT or the

Genetic Code or Emanation Creation Formation and Space-time?

The

diagonal argument seems to run thought creation as we see above, [i.e., the

matrices of every level seem to have this weird affinity with the diagonal] I

would like to suggest. then the Genetic Code and this GUT and the table of

elements can all be represented by a diagonal matrix such that.

Thus, the

are linearly

four-dimensional creatures but the elementary particles of the GUT scheme are

five dimensional.

Thus, it

seems that there was some flattening out process between the creation of the

elementary particles and the forming of atoms.

·

Perhaps

the universe is expanding inside another 5-D universe which is expanding inside

a 6-d universe etc., to infinity.

·

Perhaps

the physical expansion of the Universe in 3-Dimensional space is due to the

fact that the universe is described by a matrix. The determinant of that matrix

gives the volume of the universe.

·

Space is

a set of infinities (Cantor's Infinities), (these are the substances of

Spinoza). This is the deeper meaning of the infinities of the electron.

·

The 1

st

100 elements were divided into 10 sephirot, e.g., hydrogen is

royalty

of

royalty, helium is

Foundation of Royalty

. (After the correction helium

is

Royalty

of

Foundation

.)

·

It seems

possible that the 12 elementary substances that

The Book of Creation (sefer

Yetzirah)

refers to, are the six quark flavors and six leptons. The 8-gluons

of the strong interaction plus the two gluons of the electro­-weak interaction

(the photon and weak boson), are the light of the sephirot of the physical

universe. It’s amazing that in the

Eitz Chayim

, in the description of

akudim

,

we find light interacting with light which predicted the existence of gluons

besides the photon. The 6 quarks are the 6 sephirot of

Zeir Anpin

,

cgt + nhi

= ud + cs + tb

(Kindness)(Judgement)(Beauty)+(Victory)(Splendor)(Foundation)=(up)(down)+

(charm)(strange)+(truth)

(beauty) [Or in the new notation (top0(bottom)] and the six leptons are the 6

sephirot of nukba, while the light is drawn from the higher sephirot. Another

way of looking at it is the particles correspond to the right hand and left

hand sephirot i.e.,

wisdom

,

kindness

,

victory

= top, charm

up and understanding, power, splendor = strange, down, bottom and the middle

interaction gluons are the middle mediating sephirot.

·

The

wave-particle duality is from the root of the circular and straight sephirot

which led to the two worlds Akudim (streaked-waves) and Nekudim

(dotted-particles), which in turn led to the doubts that arise in the raisha

delo isyada (the peak that is impossible to know, which the

Eitz Chayim

goes into great length to explain what the doubts that are that are there. It's

interesting to note the doubts of the uncertainty principle arise from the wave

particle duality and the doubts in the unknown peak arise from the duality of

the streaked and spotted worlds.

·

Electro-magnetic

waves are a combination of the light of 45 and 52 -- (45 is the electric part).

·

The

Lorentz transformation is identified in terms of 10 parameters:

·

The relative velocity.

·

The 3 top sephirot.

·

The angles between the spatial coordinates

(the 3 middle sephirot), and

·

The space-time coordinates of the origin of

one coordinate system with respect to the other (the 4 lower sephirot).

Since

velocity corresponds to the 3 higher sephirot, the velocity of light is the

same in all frames of reference -- since it is above space and time. (The

concept of the higher 3 sephirot being above space and time is a very common

concept in Kabbalah). (To the photons themselves time doesn't move, all space

is one point, and its equivalent mass at that velocity is undefined.) (It's

also well known that the 3 middle ones refer to the directions of space.)

·

The first

100 elements are divided into the 10 sephirot of rulership of the physical

universe e.g., hydrogen is rulership of rulership. Helium is the foundation of

rulership. But after the correction helium is rulership of foundation, etc.,

and the order is vertical, not horizontal (as Rabbi Sar Shalom Sharabi explains

in

Nahar Shalom

)

·

7 rows of

the periodic table correspond to the seven levels surrounding royalty, and the

four orbitals (s, p, d, f) are the four letters of the Ineffable Name.

·

The 10 sephirot

of electro-magnetic radiation are:

1.

Gamma rays.

2.

X- rays.

3.

Ultra-violet is the first three sephirot.

4.

The visible spectrum is parallel to the 6 sephirot

of Beauty (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange). Red, infrared and

radio waves are Royalty.

All these

are the sephirot of the light while the elements are sephirot of the vessels.

·

When we

view the world from the Unification Table, we see that each particle can be

reduced to some set of 5 binary numbers just like in any computer, and the

state of the universe is given by the fields associated with these particles

(as Frank Wilczek writes in

Longing for the Harmonies

). This is because

the 10 sephirot are really 5 (as Rabbi Chayim Vital explains at the end of the

Eitz Chayim that there really are only 5 but they are known as 10 for the 6

th

of Zeir Anpin are really just characteristics of Beauty -- not individual sephirot).

And each universe consists of combinations of the 5 sephirot. So, the physical

universe is an intricate “computer” program of the world of Formation on the

“computer” of Creation, and so on.

·

There is

a spiritual space and time just like the physical. The laws of the spiritual

space-time continuum are the Divine Names and unifications which are parallel

to the mathematical formulas in the physical realm. (This explains the idea

that Yom Kippur is above time i.e., the spiritual time-flow, not the physical.

Also, this explains different statements of the Sages about the universe, which

seem to contradict the physical one (as the Ramchal says).

Why then

is math and physics considered holy to the Rambam? — because if it is connected

to fear of God it is the vessel for the higher holiness, and the explanation of

the higher sepherot, and the singularity of the infinite light in the center of

the empty space makes it the center of the physical realm.

Also,

since Royalty is connected directly to the Crown, when it goes up it is

immediately attached to the Crown — similar to the fact that the highest

holiness can be reached only in the physical world by doing the physical

commandments, not in the higher worlds, for only here shines the light of the

Crown.

Also, the

hidden holiness of science and math stems from the fact that the formulas are

the Divine unifications of the circular sephirot.

·

Darkness,

which the Talmud implies is a creation in itself refers to the electro-magnetic

field that permeates the universe which isn't ether but a mathematical field

which obeys Einstein's laws and has a separate existence in itself besides

light — (see Looking for the Harmonies by Frank Wilczek, p.g. 346 note 161).

·

It's

amazing how in nature totally unconnected events have the same laws connecting

them, like the number of ways “h” heads will appear if we toss a coin “n” times

which is:

†

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

which is

different than the number of combinations of n things taken h at a time  but

both have the exact same equation:

†

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Another

example is cosh  xdx  =  sinh x + c  and cos xdx = sin x + c .

Even  though

†

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

have been unconnected until Euler

found the connection. The new ideas in the field of chaos also illustrate this.

These are indicative of inner connections that cause dissimilar things to be

connected by the same laws. [Something connected with this is the fact that the

Schwarzschild radius comes out to be exactly the same as if it was formulated

in Newtonian terms thus:

1/2mv

2

=

GmM/r,so

R=2GM/c2]

[Also in

basic first year Physics, some of the laws of different systems turn out

identical, both in mechanics and in electro-magnetism.]

·

The

microscopic world is based on probability while the macroscopic world is based

on classical physics. The connection is that between the world of chaos and of

correction. Chaos is the higher root but then from the elements of chaos

(atoms) God created the macroscopic world based on correction. Spiritually also

we are only microscopically subject to the laws of chaos but our macroscopic

souls are based on correction. So its true that individual prayer depends on

not being observed only on the higher level of chaos but there still is a level

of correction where flow exists despite being observed.

·

The

number of laws of the Torah (10 general, 613 specific) equals the number of the

components of the field of the empty space (i.e. 10 sephirot, and 613 parts of

the soul). Of the Ten Commandments only the last 6 determine the rate of

spiritual change while the first 4 limit the initial conditions, but allow for

any arbitrary rate of change (this is if you go by the divisions of the Hebrew

Bible and count every paragraph as one commandment. This is actually how the

Catholic Church divides them.)) The reason for the division 6 and 4 is that the

letter He (the 5 colors) divides up into a Vav (6) and a Dalet (4) as it comes

down through the world of waves (Akudim). Then the Vav is divided into two

Vavs, 6 quarks and 6 leptons. From here it seems that the 6 quarks and leptons

come from the 6 field equations of General Relativity that determine future

events.

·

The

determinant of the matrix that determines the universe isn't equal to zero, so

that matrix has to have a unique solution — and so it has to have the same

number of variables as equations. I think that gives a 4x4 matrix, since the

variables are the position in space and time.

·26

The

inverse-square laws of the universe come as one equation:

KMm + G M m m + (some constant for the weak force) M m + (some

constant for the strong force) M m=r

2

[This is the equation of a 4D

sphere].

·

“When a

rotating black hole forms the outer horizon it settles like a quivering bubble

toward the ultimate stable state represented by Kerr's solution to Einstein's

equations. This quivering of the outer horizon produces ripples in space-time,

gravitational waves, that spread both outward and inward. The ones that fall in

are blue shifted. Since

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

, the inflow of blue shifted gravitational radiation

that carries energy will produce an increase in the mass inside the black hole,

increasing a core mass that starts out with just five times the mass of the sun

going to

10

57

times the mass of the entire universe.

This

can't reach the outer universe, but at the big crunch when all the black holes

merge, such intense gravitational fields are involved that the whole universe

will collapse to the Plank scale. The rest of the collapse takes only

10

-43

seconds (Plank time).

At that

time the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of the black hole becomes

meaningless and the total entropy is reduced drastically.

At the

same time, because there is no duration less than

10

-43

seconds (just like there is no distance shorter than

10

-33

centimeters),

the collapsing universe 10

-43

seconds away from the singularity

bounces back to become an expanding universe (since this doesn't defy entropy).

This

does away (almost) with the problem of the buildup of entropy from one cycle of

an oscillating universe to the next. But there still is a small buildup of

entropy from one cycle to the next. It seems possible that the origins of the

universe can be traced back through successively shorter cycles to some initial

tiny seed, a baby universe produced by a quantum fluctuation out of nothing at

all”.

is also a quality which is impossible to know the exact amount. This may relate

to uncertainty of momentum or time. For the uncertainty of momentum is

inversely proportional to p.

·

The speed

of light is the same for all observers because it is the speed of time through

the 5th dimension.

·

The idea

of the four elements of air, fire, water and ground is quite literal (but also

simply means the states of energy, gas, liquid and solid. The Kabbalah, when it

took over this idea from the Greeks, meant it in a different way than the

Greeks, i.e., that the four letters of the Ineffable Name permeate every aspect

of creation. So, on every level there is a division into four parts which are

really 8 because the Kabbalah puts together the Ineffable Name with Adonai e.g.,

each of the four represent a state, but also represent the actual substances

that make up fire or water. I would like to suggest my own four primordial

substances that existed in the early universe quarks, leptons, photons, gluons

(ground, water, fire, air).

·

I would

like to suggest that String Theory has its roots in the four flows coming from Adam

Kadmon: notes, vowels, crowns and letters, -- e.g., the Crown of Wisdom are

musical notes, and the nine lower

sephirot

are the vowels, and the Crown

of Understanding are the crowns of the letters, and the lower nine sephirot are

letters.

Now all

of these four levels are in the form of letters, but the letters of the Crown

of Wisdom are in the form of musical notes. The crowns themselves are letters

in the form of the circular notes e.g.

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

i.e.,

closed strings -- the open strings are vowels and crowns. This works amazingly

well, for it is a great principle in kabbalah that each particle in the

physical realm contains a letter. When we find that the letters themselves come

in this way, it seems to be a confirmation of string theory in Kabbalah, though

it is far from confirmed in the physical realm. [I know that looks suspiciously

like the tertiary structures of the proteins.]

·

This is

probably superfluous to mention but I find it very interesting that the DNA

molecule have 26 parts which is the numerical value of the Four letter name of

God

éä”åä

which relates to the sepherah of Beauty which is the

sepherah of Man. The bases GTCA clearly are the four letters Aleph Dalet Nun

Yod, thus:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And their

inner root is Yod He Vav He and the specific shape of the letter Aleph

determines the structure of the DNA, i.e., the bottom “kotz” is the base, or

Malchut... [The Vav is an extended Yod.] The fifteen operations are the

numerical value of the first two letters

é”ä.

Now, here the connections are clear, but

what would be the result of knowing this I don't know.

I suspect

that with this knowledge each discipline can teach about the other, but this

job is usually left for the discoverer of the idea itself. Each nucleotide is

made up of three letters which correspond to the division of the name 72 into

groups of three letters each:

[

{acid(ACGT), base(phosphate), sugar(ribose)} = {judgement, beauty, kindness}.]

There are

10 nucleotides per revolution which corresponds to the  10 letters of the name

45. The DNA is Kindness and Judgement together [the name 72 and 42, each

containing ten four-letter names as the inner light].

Out of

this combination comes the mRNA [beauty, the name 22]. It goes through the

three lower sephirot Eternity, Splendor, Foundation -- and out comes Royalty: the

proteins.

·33

Even

though there is no known way of summing up all infinitely many Feynman diagrams,

to get an expression for a fully renormalized electron, I think the secret may

be contained in an idea along these lines: the area under the curve of y=1/x is

finite even though it is infinitely long i.e.,

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

. Thus, there is a way

for the strange loops that encompass creation to be brought down to one point

though we may not know what it is.

·

The five

Peano Axioms

[12]

capture the essence of natural numbers as the axioms of Euclid capture the

essence of Plane Geometry. After one has them, he can theoretically build up by

axioms and rules of logic the complete system. These axioms are the atoms of

the system and correspond to the five

partzufim

[forms] of Crown,

Father, Mother, Son, Daughter. The five axioms of Human behavior are the last

five of the Ten Commandments. [This is in accordance with the Rambam's way of

looking at the commandments as having their reality and essence in pure logic. According

to him, the commandments have a reality separate from the fact that they are

written in the Torah -- for even if they weren't we would have to obey them

from reason. Thus, I am inclined to believe that these last five are axioms in

the sense that transgressing them evokes a bad reaction on a person as a law of

nature. Thus, even in cases where one thinks he has some permission from the

Oral Law, I think one shouldn't depend on it.

·

I think

gravity is simply an inverse rubber band, i.e., matter pulls space-time out of

shape. But instead of the distortion in shape pulling things apart it pushes

them together. [I also think the electro-magnetic field is the same thing].

Chapter 3 – Torah Ideas

·

And God said,

“let there be light and there was light.” That is the thread of his infinite

light which shone into the darkness of the empty space.

And God

said, “Let there be a firmament,” which was the roof top of the empty space to

divide between his infinite light, and the empty space.

The

waters above the empty space I don't know. The waters below are the space-time

continuum.

The seven

days of creation are the seven circles of light before the straight light was

created.

The

luminaries are wisdoms letting in God's infinite light, through the firmament

into the empty space.

·

The

non-Jews at the time of Mordechai and Ester: The 1

st

verse says they

became Jewish because the fear of the Jews fell upon them, i.e. the fear of

that which the Jews fear fell upon them, i.e. fear of the punishment of God. A

later verse says they became Jewish because the fear of Mordechai fell upon

them, i.e. that fear that Mordechai feared, i.e. fear and awe of the greatness

of God.

·

“The king

of Sodom said to Abraham give me the soul and the money take for yourself”, i.e.,

the evil inclination offers one lots of money as long as he sells his soul.

·

God said

to Abraham go from your land from your birthplace and your father's house to

the land I will show you, i.e., from the 3 dimensions of his world into the 4th

dimension. Later, this actually occurred as the sages say on the verse, “and He

took him outside,” i.e., out of the 3D of this world. (This idea is hinted to

in one of Rabbi Nachman's stories.)

·

The trait

of Abraham is kindness. Therefore, his test was to see if he could be cruel in

a case where God demanded it. The trait of Jacob is truth, therefore his test

was to see if he could lie in the case where God demanded it. For Gods will is

the definition of truth and kindness. — so, when God commands a cruel deed that

deed is by definition kind. That is why the verse attributes kindness to

Abraham, because he was willing to be cruel when God demanded it. So, when he

was kind we know the kindness was real because it was connected to God. The

same goes for Jacob.

·

Abraham

could be a Lamdan [dialectic Talmudic scholar] when he wanted to. He said, “She

is my sister,” even though he had to stretch the truth beyond recognition to

say so. But when God told him “Bring up Issac as a burn offering,” in which

case he could have said it means bring up, i.e., put him on the alter and then

take him down — which was in fact the final intention. But when it came to a

commandment of God he didn't try to find a way out by using semantics.

·

How did

Esther know on the 2nd day to ask the King her request and not the 1

st

?

Because on the 1st day he asked “What is your request, Esther,” but on the 2nd

day he asked  “What is your request, Queen Esther?”

·

On the 3

rd

day (the 3

rd

trait Beauty — the 3

rd

day when the Torah

was given) Esther (the Divine Presence) stood before the inner house of the

King (the singularity of infinite light in the center of the empty space). She

was wearing the surrounding light so the King was pleased with her. He reached out

with the golden rod (the thin beam of his infinite light). She touched it and

was saved.

·

Every

verse in the Torah is a matrix by which the subject of that verse comes into

being. A matrix is an array of numbers, each representing the value of a

variable. These variables can be algebraic, here I mean the term to be applied

to spiritual variables and variable equations in the creation.

·

On Rosh

HaShanah there is a new Big Bang due to the reversing of Einstein's equations

for a black hole. On Yom Kippur time stands still because the light from Rosh

HaShanah gets to the bottom of the empty space where there is the singularity.

So, as a result of repentance one should experience a new birth.

·

The days

of creation are actually the 7 divine traits and not time at all. Only in the

lower garden of Eden did time pass. In the upper garden of Eden it is still

Friday, the day Adam was thrown out. After Adam was thrown out he began to

measure time at the rate of the physical universe. This is not dependent on the

‘Shemita opinion.’ It's just that in the higher and lower worlds time passes at

different rates — and in Atzilus there is no time at all. However, this can go

along with the Shemita opinion — for as time went slowly in Gan Eden, billions

of years passed in the physical universe.

(The

Shemita opinion puts us in the 4th cycle of 7000 year periods each of which has

a 1000 year day. This is the opinion of Rabbi Issaac of Acco who lived about

800 years ago. It's interesting that this opinion corresponds to modern

astronomy). However, if we accept that Rabbi Nachman objected to the Shemita

principle then it is possible that the time axis of the physical universe was

simply folded up into a little ball of string where theoretically you could

have miles of string in the distance of a few inches. The Shemita idea seems to

be supported by the fact that the Torah says that first God created heaven and

earth without saying how long that took. Then it goes through a different world

of creation in which there was a spiritual garden of Eden that Adam was placed

in. This isn't in the physical universe at all. Then, it says he was thrown out

of the garden of Eden and into the physical world which had been created before

that. So, an honest look at the Torah shows that it never even implies anywhere

how long the creation of the physical universe was.

·

The

contradiction between the Divine fore-knowledge and free will is that God knows

what one will chose not just from the future but from now (i.e. not just

because He knows the future). This contradiction is the root of Quantum

Mechanics.

·

Creativity

on the right side of the brain is from the

sepherah

of Wisdom. Order is

from the left from the sepherah of Understanding. Logical creativity which

relates to order, and a deeper creativity, is the combination of the two called

Knowledge — but all three permeate the entire body as it says in Drush HaDaas

at the end of the Eitz Chayim.

The

deeper creativity is much more covered, and with the vessel of Eternity Splendor

and Foundation of Understanding and Eternity, Splendor and Foundation of Wisdom.

(This last comment is referring just to Emanation, which is different than the

whole picture referred to in Drush HaDaas.) Thus, we find creative people who

aren't smart — because smartness in general is from the sepherah of

understanding which is open and quick to understand. But the deeper sepherah of

Wisdom is slow and not quick to understand, but after a long process of

absorbing the idea, it is able to create something totally new — which the left-brain

people reject, because it's too off-beat for them. Thus, we find that Einstein

was a slow learner.

·

Everything

under the level of the lower six sephirot (which are opposites) turns into its

opposite and then back again, in constant oscillation. So we find the

enlightened Islam of the middle ages becoming the barbaric Islam of today, and

the dark Christianity of the Middle Ages becoming the loving Christianity of

today. The same loving Chasidut of the Baal Shem Tov has become the fascist

Chasidut of today. Only by one rising up to the level of the 3 first sephirot

can one escape this pattern. I think science is in its root on that level (i.e.

what the sages call the higher wisdom) However when science falls from its

higher root it can become just a tool for evil (the Torah is on the level of

Beauty one of the lower sephirot.)

·

When the

angel called out, “Abraham Abraham” and he said “here I am” and he said “put

out not your hand to the child, and do nothing to him for now I know that you

fear God, and you have not withheld your son, your only one from me.” (Or more

literally your singularity from me i.e. the center part of his being i.e. the

center of the black hole.)

·

The Torah

applies on many different levels, the microscopic and macroscopic, e.g., the

interactions between subatomic particles is described in the

parashah

of

forbidden sexual relationships, e.g., the interaction of an electron and an

anti-electron is described by the law on the prohibition of sex between a

brother and sister. The Torah also applies to the physics of stars and higher

spiritual planes. On the human level also there are many levels of application.

People can keep the Shabbat on a physical level but sill desecrate it on a

spiritual level and vise versa.

·

The

reason Rabbi Nachman says “There is nothing besides Him” is literal in the

Torah the subject of the verb is understood to be ‘the doer of the verb”

without its being written. So the subject of the verb exists is 'anything that

does it', and here the verse is saying there is nothing which does this verb

except God.

·

After Eliezer

saw that Rivka had fulfilled his conditions why wasn't he convinced that she

was the right one? He asked give me water and she agreed and then she said and

I will give water to all your camels too. And thus she did. Why wasn't that

enough “why does it say after that the man was astounded at her, being quiet to

know if God had given  him success or not? The answer is the next verse, “When

the camels finished drinking then he took the jewelry etc.” For you can give a

camel to drink and it can finish it and you have to give it more. Eliezer

wanted to see if she would do more than just do what she said she would do. He

wanted to see if she would

COMPLETE

what she said she would do. Only

then could he know that she was worthy to be Issac's wife.

·

“And

Moses called to Betzalel and  to Eliav and to every person wise of heart that

God put wisdom in his heart, all that decided to come close to the work to do

it.” Exodus 36:2. It is clear that just by the fact that they wanted to do

God's work, God gave them the wisdom necessary to do it. Wisdom isn't necessary

to learn, only the desire to do the work and to actually do it. The wisdom God

will add later.

·

The idea

of the Strange Loop exists in the Torah, e.g., “Remember what Amalek did to

you.” Now, if the Torah hadn't commanded us to forget Amalek, no one would

remember him. But, since the Torah commands us to be sure not to forget to

forget Amalek,

now

we all remember him.

Just like

the double negatives in genetics. Even Hegel noticed the double negatives.

These things indicate a deeper level. Just like for number theory to be correct

we need to postulate super-numbers. [This indicates the need for the Oral Law. However,

since the 13 principles, by which the Torah is explained, teaches that such

contradictions need to be explained by a third verse which is on the level of

the written law, so I am not so sure about this last point unless we go like

the Rambam who considers the things derived by the Thirteen Principles to be

Rabbinical. Perhaps the Torah itself hints to its own inner level?]

·

The

Strange Loops exist through the Torah. We do all the mitzvot in gratitude that

God brought us out of slavery, but we are allowed to own slaves. Yaakov lied

saying I am Esau, but we attribute the trait of Truth to him, “Give truth to

Yakov...” [Unless that means give him truth because he doesn't have any]. But

if the spies to Israel said the truth we get on their backs. We borrow the

money of the Egyptians, but we don't give it back because we earned it, but we

don't pay back our slaves. Abraham was ready to do a very cruel deed, but we

attribute the trait of kindness to him. “Honor your father and mother”, yet

Moses praised the tribe of Levi for killing their parents when they were guilty

of idolatry. “Who says to his father and mother I have not seen them...”

The truth

is, all these things point to a deeper level, as strange loops do. [But the

simple explanation is that the patriarchs and the Jewish people were and are

flawed, but God chose them anyway.

·

Every

openly evil deed done by anyone Jewish in the Bible we have an excuse — e.g.,

for “The Holy spirit told him so.” Every good deed by a non-Jew we attribute it

to evil motives. The reason is that the Talmud was written at a period of

extreme animosity towards the Gentiles. Now even though it is inspired by God

it still comes through the vessels of the souls of the people then.

·

Abraham

said, “the gods tricked me”. Apparently, he believed there are other gods but

that they are under the rule of the One Creator. This isn't a new point. The

Sages obviously believed the angels or princes appointed over each nation is

its god, and Michael is the archangel of Israel, as it says in Daniel.

·

When Rashi

says ‘Tikun Sofrim’ it means simply that the verse was changed later by the

sofrim. Apparently, this happened also in the verse “he set the boundaries of

the nations according to the number of the children of Israel.” The Dead Sea Scrolls

have the number of the children of God. This isn't

apikorsus

to believe —

unless you want to say too that Rashi was an

apikorus

. To tell the truth,

modern orthodoxy would consider the Rambam also to be an apikorus.

·

The oral

law are the meanings that the written text triggers, and the written law is the

open and hidden meanings that are contained in the text itself. In reality,

there is no way to totally understand the meaning of any verse of the torah

since that would mean understanding the implications of its connections to

every person until the end of time. That is why there is no infallible method

for telling true from false statements in number theory —because statements

imply meaning, which has infinite levels. [GEB, p. 561, 582]

·

The

dichotomy between Relativity and quantum mechanics is possibly related to the

Strange Loops in Mathematical logic, i.e.,  relativity is from the sephirot of

Yosher, and quantum reality is from Igulim.

·

There is

a special type of holiness the Patriarchs handed down one to the other. This is

the subject of the blessings. This is different than a normal blessing one

gives to another but a special type of holiness in quality and quantity. This

came to Joseph as Rashi explains on the verses of the blessing Yakob gave to

him. Rashi says there “The blessing of the Patriarchs”. Thus the Jewish people

are only the physical descendants of the Patriarchs. To find the people that

received the blessing of Joseph one would have to know where his two tribes

went to, for the Jewish people today are Judah and Benjamin. It seems there is

a different spiritual Israel, different than the Jewish people that received

this blessing.

[28]

Each

sentence of the Torah has a noun which is the root of matter and a verb which

is the root of energy.So the four worlds corresponding to the four Hebrew words

for doing or making refer to the four forces.The strong force- physicality.The

weak force-formation. The electromagnetic force-creation.Gravitation Emanation.

Chapter 4 – Rabbi Nachman from

Breslov

·

Rabbi

Nachman is the only tzadik that allows himself to be tested experimentally by

making solid statistical predictions easy to test experimentally. E.g. “Shabbat

and the Torah give physical life (not just spiritual).” Although you can say

that the Christians have Jesus which balances that out, but then you could test

it with religious and non-religious Jews. Honesty shouldn't make a difference

for their degree of honesty isn't that different. Now there are lots of

differences by each individual like smoking but or going to Uman for Rosh

Hashanah, but all the variables should average out to give people who keep

Shabbat and learn Torah a longer life.

·2

Rabbi

Nachman's ideas in the Lekutei Moharan are general principles applying to

people, and to show the inter-relationship between the ideas, but not as

advice. This is because any general principal changes dramatically when applied

to the individual and only the individual himself can know how it applies to

him. This is the idea of uniting Correction and Chaos together, for when you

draw the higher light of Chaos into the vessels of Correction you get a

different result than drawing the light of Correction into the vessels of Chaos.

·

(Power) x

(t)/(m)x(a)=x;

i.e., the

distance the sephirot are lifted during the year. This is why it's important to

go to Uman on Rosh Hashanah, for the vertical column of light of power is

there.

·

Rabbi

Nachman hints at the basic principle of Quantum Mechanics, that seeing makes

the vessel (i.e. that observing the photon wave makes it take particle form.

(It's interesting to note that in the Eitz Chayim of Rabbi Issac Luria, mass

(the vessel) is considered dense energy, so apparently he knew intuitively the

mass energy equivalence).

·

In the

Lekutai Moharan we find many things which lead to the divine spirit or

salvation etc. These are independent variables that effect the final result. So

lets say children are dependent on the land of Israel, the succah, prayer etc.

Then, children = A(land of Israel) + B(succah) + C(prayer) + …… + D; where A,

B, C and D are constants. So, if succah and prayer would remain the same, and

the land of Israel would go up by one unit, then children would go up by an

amount of A. We assume here that the effects of the land of Israel and Succah

and prayer are additive, i.e., that the amount that Succah effects them doesn't

depend on the amount that the land of Israel affects them.

We could

use a computer with a statistical package to get the values of the coefficients

(even though it's probable that every person would end up having his own

coefficients). Also, we could use the

t

statistic to test the

possibility that one of these things has no effect on children. To prove to the

doubters, who say that none of these things have an effect we could use the

F

statistic. You could do this with every chapter in the Lekutai Moharan and thus

come out with some results for all the coefficients, which could serve for some

practical guidance in ones life. [For it is likely that people’s coefficients

don't vary that much one from one another.]

Without

knowing the value of the coefficients, it’s impossible to know how much each

variable effects the situation, and since doing one

mitzvah

(commandment) invariably takes time and effort from another one, one can verify

what he should be doing in order to achieve his goals. (Even though you may

have different coefficients than everybody else, it’s unlikely that yours will

be significantly different than your immediate peer group, so if you have a

general idea of the value of the statistics you can know what you should

emphasize without having to waste years experimenting with things that may have

little effect on your overall happiness). Even though it is true that much

depends on your own trust in God and other variables, so you could ask how is

it possible to reduce your personal happiness and success in so many areas as

the Lekutai Moharan does to a simple mathematical formula.

The

answer is that much of one's own trust in God can be determined by his peer

group, for no righteous or great person appears in a vacuum. Baba Sali in Morocco

was surrounded by a spirit of fear of God. Spinoza and Rabbi Moshe Chayim

Lutzato were deeply affected by the atmosphere of philosophy in Amsterdam (why

else would Rabbi Lutzato be the sole saint to create a coherent philosophical

analysis of the

Kabbalah

, very similar to what Spinoza did for

philosophy in general).

By doing

repentance on a sin you get some Divine inspiration. Then, you do repentance

again since you realize your first repentance wasn't good enough in accordance

with your increased awareness of God's greatness. The second time you repent,

your repentance is better so you get a higher degree of inspiration, i.e.,

inspiration times some number k which is more than one. The third time you

repent you increase your previous inspiration [which was (inspiration)(k)] by a

factor of k again

—

since your inspiration was increased by by that amount. So you get

(inspiration) (k

2

)

If you do that n times, your inspiration will be (inspiration) (

k

2

). Now

back to the beginning. At the time you did the second repentance you also do a

repentance on your first repentance since your realize that it wasn't complete.

The first time you repent on your first repentance you get some inspiration.

The second time you get (inspiration)(k). The next time you get (inspiration)

(k

2

). Now, at the time you do your third repentance on the sin, and

the second repentance on the first repentance, you do your first repentance on

the second repentance.

So at the

time you have done this process n times you have Inspiration(kn) + inspiration (kn-1)

+…+ inspiration. If you take the limit as you do this an infinite number of

times you get the  Integral(inspiration) (kn)] dn = (Inspiration) (kn)/(ln k)

where the ln k signifies the lower dot of the

aleph

[the Divine name 52]

and the dividing sign is the line dividing the

aleph

and kn is the top

dot of the

aleph

[the Divine name 161].

The way

of learning of Rabbi Nachman includes two different points. One that just by

saying the words the understanding comes into the mind. The other is to learn

in order without skipping around. My idea of saying the words backwards comes

from the Ari and the aal Shem Tov who have different unifications based on that

idea, and the Ramchal explains in his

New Zohar

that the saying

of the words backwards brings the light back to the source -- so it's like

sewing -- where it is helpful to go backwards also. The practical way of

implementing this is to have a place marker in the several books that one needs

to learn and have a certain fixed amount that one does of each one each day.

·

In that

same lesson in the

Lekutai Moharan

, vol 1. chapt. 6, we see that the

amount that the honor of God is increased depends on how much the person has

changed from a state of sin to the state of good and the change one has of

greater honor to lesser, i.e. the honor of God isn't dependent on one's being

good but rather on change from a lower to a higher state, and similarly there

is a need for an active lessening of ones own honor. Therefore the proper

relationship is

:

Honor of God =

D

State of goodness

is that

goodness or

D

Self-honor

.

these are two independent variables as we take the limit as

The

general solution of this linear partial differential equation will contain two

arbitrary functions. I think they are the finding of one's proper partner as

mentioned in Lekutai Moharan [vol 2] and becoming included in the Higher Man

who sits on the Throne which is the result of doing the higher and lower

repentance of chap. 6. This would explain why these two things result from the

higher and lower repentance mentioned in this chapter [i.e., chapter 6 of the

Lekutai Moharan]

If one

has masturbated he should say the 10 psalms, 16, 32, 41, 42, 57, 77, 90, 105,

137, 150 and immerse himself in a natural body of water all on that same day as

Rabbi Nachman said.

·

To

sweeten the judgments, I would recommend having in every city at least one

person learning Zohar, Lekutei Moharan and other kabbalah books in such a way

that when he is tired there is another to take his place and continue from the

place he stopped. [See Ginzay HaRamchal where I got this idea from.]

This

would be good in particular by the graves of the righteous where the lower

level of their soul hovers. For the individual can say the ten psalms of Rabbi

Nachman,

16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150

which are on the

level of the crown, then the Song of songs on the level of wisdom, then Numbers

ch. 28, on the level of understanding than Exodus chapt. 28:15 to 28:30, then

Exodus 26:7 to 26:15; the part about the increase in the prayer book, the two

blessings that Moses blessed the tribes at the end of Deuteronomy and the

divine chariot in Ezikiel.

Time is

in Kabbalah a ‘perfect form’ and has 613 parts, and an inner essence, and an

outer essence. The faster one goes the closer he gets to the inner essence, and

thus time slows down. (This is what Rabbi Nachman calls “the time becomes

unified into one and the length becomes shorter — what Rabbi Nachman calls “The

Place” becomes unified into one. Here, Rabbi Nachman predicts the existence of

black-holes with a singularity inside).

This

means that time is like an electro-magnetic wave that flows through the time

field. So, one year is four spiritual waves, the Rosh Hashanah wave starting

and finishing on Rosh Hashanah. (But this is different in terms that its

highest point is on Shavuot and lowest on Tisha BeAv), and at right angles to

it is the month wave (starting in Nissan), and at a right angle to that is the

week wave and then there is the day wave, so the whole thing is one big shear

wave in 4 dimensions traveling through the time field like a gravitational wave

in the space time field. Rabbi Nachman says the month wave used to start on

Passover (i.e. like a cosine function where the origin is the highest point but

now he says it originates on Purim.

·

There are

infinite levels that the Lekutai Moharan works on. The Lekutai Moharan was

meant to be valid and consistent at every possible level as I heard once from

some university professor on the way to Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashanah. Before

that I had believed that every level in it was one specific level and my only

question was how to verify which level it was speaking about. Now I believe

that in each specific world the Lekutai Moharan has a specific level but it

applies to each world differently. I also think that the books of the Baal

HaTanya in general contain the hints necessary to decipher the intent of the

Lekutai Moharan in Emanation.

·

Rabbi

Nachman predicts the fact that in a large gravitational field, time slows down,

for by the Divine Presence where there is a large amount of energy he says the

time becomes unified into a singularity.

·

Rabbi

Nachman said even on the left side there is a right and a left. This means that

all spiritual systems are like a vertical totem pole with the wisdom on top but

what determines a person's spirituality isn't the vertical level but the

horizontal closeness to the vertical column (of the infinite light). For

instance, lets say a person is Jewish — that puts him on a high rung of the

ladder. But it doesn't have anything to do with whether he is good or evil.

Only the horizontal closeness to

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

determines that. [i.e., only

the x-coordinate determines good or evil. The y-coordinate determines the rung

of existence], and further even in good or evil there is right and left. That

is, the evil of evil or the good of evil, i.e. that even an evil person won't

go to that degree of evil.

·

Concerning

the way of learning recommended by Rabbi Nachman — of just saying the words in

order, and having faith that one will eventually understand — it is interesting

to see the

Maharsha

on

Avoda Zara

19a, who says that the two ways

of learning of just saying the words, or being exact, and repeating the ideas

over and over until one gets it is a argument in the Gemara over there.

Then, the

Gemara says that the rabbis knew the statements about learning carefully but

didn't listen to it because they followed the advice of just saying the words.

To the Maharsha, Rav Nachman bar Issac learned in the quick way but still had

success in his learning. [The argument if Sinai is better or uprooter of

mountains would also seem to be relevant. The Gemara concludes that Sinai is

better.] <???> <What do you mean by uprooter of mountains or

sinai?>

·

There are

five books of Rabbi Nachman: three are his exact words, and two are the things

Rabbi Nathan remembered that he said and wrote down. There are no other

traditions from him contrary to what is commonly supposed.

For

instance, there is a commonly known saying which he said, that there would be

no other Rebbi after him. However, when a Rav of Breslov died in Safed years

ago, all the Breslovers made it a point to advertise throughout the Jewish

community in New York that the Rav of Breslov had died for the publicity they

would get from it. No Breslover then in Jerusalem, or New York, or Safed said

anything about this supposed tradition.

However,

when only a few years later when Rav Shick started printing books that had his

picture on them, and written underneath was, “The Leader of Breslov” [and Rav

Shick was already very unpopular with the Breslover community for years] all of

a sudden this tradition popped up.

Now when

did Rabbi Nachman say it? If before the guy from Safed died, why did nobody

remember it then? Then it must be that it was after that guy died. But Rabbi

Nachman himself passed away two hundred years ago. So it is obvious that Rabbi

Nachman never said such a thing — and this is just another example of a very

common phenomenon I have noticed in the Orthodox community, i.e., making up

history to suit their political and financial needs.

·

Though

Rabbi Nachman attacked the

Guide

to the

Perplexed, there are many

principles that he gets from there, like that “taking care of the body comes

before taking care of the soul,” (

Guide

III:27). Or the idea that

prophecy is an extension of the power of imagination [the

Guide

II:38],

the idea that prophecy is by an angel to all prophets except Moses [the

Guide

II:24].

·

Advice

from Rabbi Nachman has to be taken with a grain of salt, i.e., what he would

call Tzitzum. The mikvah may be able to sweeten judgements but what about the

guy that was killed in Israel going to the mikvah and the child that died after

his parent put him in the  freezing mikvah of the Ari. in Safed.Even if one has

had seed come out of him at night, Rabbi Nachman said it is nothing unless it

came also with sexual thoughts. The reason the mikvah no  longer works like it

did for the Baal Shem Tov is that for him it was a time for  private prayer.

Now that it is no longer private it is a waste of time unless in the case that

Rabbi Nachman specifically said it for.

All the

advice of Rabbi Nachman has to be taken in this way--think: “Will this action

increase my devakus in God ?” If the logical answer to that question is no then

even if Rabbi Nachman said it is a good thing to do, he meant it for a

different situation than the one that exists now for you. The only thing that

he said one must do regardless of whether it increases his personal devakus or

not is to be by him for every Rosh Hashanah

·

Rabbi

Nachman explains that in the higher Intelligence time goes slower and in that

all the days of one’s life are instantaneous. The reason for this is that from

the point of view of one who is moving at the speed of light all, events,

future and past, appear simultaneously. Thus, the way to get attached to God,

and included in that higher Intelligence, is by moving at the speed of light in

spiritual terms. Of course, that is impossible for matter: therefore, one has

to go into a closet and not be seen by himself or others, and then his wave

function can be manifested, and he can become attached to God by attaching

their thoughts to Him. However, since sin separates one from God as it says in

the verse, “your sins were dividing between you and your God”, one needs go to

the grave of Rabbi Nachman. However, the idea of serving God is not to be

attached to any saint but to God alone; one should try to attach himself to God

directly. Attaching oneself to a saint may not be idolatry, since the saint is

attached himself to God, but it still isn't the main idea. However,

unattachment to God as when one's mind is occupied with things separate from

God,

is

idolatry. Yet, by faith that there is nothing besides Him, one

can serve God by himself himself all things.

·

Rabbi

Nachman apparently hold

s

that prayer is above Torah, and the Talmud says

learning Torah [even one word -- the mishnah in

Peah

makes clear that

there is no lower limit to the amount, i.e., even an infinitesimal amount of

learning is more than all the commandments -- which includes prayer] is above

all

mitzvot

. One [Rabbi Nathan’s] explanation is that prayer for

physical things is below Torah, as the sages mentioned about the student in an

incident that he was praying when he should have been learning. Yet this isn't

a good answer since Rabbi Yochanan disagrees in that very case and says, “If

only a person would pray all day”.

The Baal HaTanya

says in the latter days things have changed, and I thought this sounds

outrageous; however, when we reflect on it, I think we can see his point. For

the root of the Torah is the Name 45 and the root of the

mitzvot

is 52

and so perhaps after a certain point in time the flow of light shifted from

going down [the name 45] to going up [52], so that now prayer connects one to

the flow of light. As I always find that things the Baal HaTanya says that

sound the most outrageous usually have the most sense.

·

The idea

of Rabbi Nachman of life being like the form of the aleph means like the form

of a Clothoid

[13]

.

The highest level is an asymptote which can never be reached, for it is God

himself. But, by being included in God, one reaches it. However, this is only

on the level of the first infinity. In the Geometry where the asymptote is the

second infinity, one has to start the process all over again. This is the

reason why people’s lives are a series of ups and downs -- and the ups and

downs get more frequent as time goes by but less dramatically, since the radius

of curvature increases proportionally to how far you are from the origin [your

birth]. This also explains why in the explanation of the higher repentance,

Rabbi Nachman describes an integral, since in fact the x-coordinate of a person

progressing towards that point is

x=a



n

cosTd

This also

explains the reason, for the



/2 is the equation for uncertainty, which is the root of this universe,

for this comes from the asymptotes of the formula for the Clothoid [a(



/2)

1/2

,

a(



/2)

1/2

)

·

In the

Christian world there has been a great debate between the two poles -- of

individual spirituality versus that of the group, according to the level one

holds in the hierarchy and the need to receive ones holiness from the rabbi or

the priest etc.

Now Rabbi

Nachman combines both poles. For, to him, the importance of belief in wise men

is of utmost importance. Yet, he also stresses individual spirituality, and

says that each person has in him a level of the Messiah. But he combines these

ideas, for he says that one really has three centers of mass that he must revolve

around: that of himself, of his friend and of his teacher.
