Section V - Christianity

Chapter 1 – Jesus Christ

·

The

argument against Jesus is primarily based on the references in the Talmud

against a certain Yeshu which was a common name at the time and the book “Seder

Olam” refers to three Jesus's that lived at that time, and one that lived at

the beginning on the second temple period who was the disciple of Rabbi

Yehoshua Ben Chananya. Historically, there was a famous Jesus also at the

actual time of the Destruction of the Temple that used to walk around the city

of Jerusalem predicting it's doom. The Tikunai Zohar also has a reference

against Jesus. However, in all fairness it seems likely that the Zohar and the

Gemara were in fact referring to Jesus and in fact didn't like him.

·

Rabbenu

Asher (the Rosh) writes at the end of Gittin that the Jesus mentioned there is

not Jesus Christ. To say that the other places where that same person is

mentioned in the Talmud are him would require a proof, of which there is none.

In fact, the facts of the life of Jesus have been corroborated by at least 60 non-Christian

documents, and none of the stories of the Talmud about Yeshu fit any of the

facts about Jesus we are forced to admit that the Yeshu of the Talmud is not

Jesus Christ, rather someone else at the beginning of the 2

nd

-Temple

period who was a disciple of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Perachiya, as the Talmud says,

while Jesus Christ of Nazareth was born 400 years later.

·

According

to Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, Jesus is the Messiah son of Joseph -- a preliminary

stage before the Messiah son of David, i.e., the sephirah of Foundation. The

concept of a messiah from Efraim is brought in the Gemarah Zohar, especially in

the works of Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato, and the Gra in Kol Hator (i.e., the

sephirah of Foundation). (He [Rabbi Abulafia] also says things about the cross

which would imply that Jesus didn't lose his high level of Messiah son of

Joseph any time. Yet, he also says the verse “you shouldn't have a false god”

applies to Jesus -- meaning that the church after him did fall into idolatry.)

What is

significant about the opinion of Rabbi Abulafia is that all the major

kabbalists accept him as an authority. Rabbi Chayim Vital quotes him

extensively in vol. 4 of Shaarai Kedusha, and Rabbi Moshe Cordovaro quotes his

books all throughout the Pardes. The Chida (Rabbi Chayim David Azulai) has a

section on him in Shemos Hagedolim, and concludes that he was in fact a great

saint). (The fact that Rabbi Abulafia did write this about Jesus is easy to see

for anyone who wants to take the time to go to the basement of the national

library at Hebrew University and look at the microfilm copies of his books.

(Professor

Moshe Aidel has written and published extensively about Rabbi Abulafia.) (The

Halachah in the long run will turn out to be that since the validity of Jesus

is a debate among the Rishonim (authorities of the Middle Ages) either

accepting him or not is valid according to the Torah rules, and neither one way

or the other can be excluded from valid Judaism. (It would be pretty hard to

exclude Rabbi Chayim Vital from valid Judaism after he has made his way into

the Shulchan Aruch and the Mishna Berura. In fact, the authorities in the

Shulchan Aruch sometimes hold an opinion, but then write that after they found

out that the Kabbalah said differently, they withdraw it, for “who can go after

the lion?”).

·

Rabbi Abulafia's

idea is crystal clear. In a nutshell it is that Jesus was a prelude to the

redemption. For, at the original breaking of the spiritual vessels of

nekudim

the vessel of the sephirah of Foundation (Jesus) broke because of the light

coming into it from the higher sephirot -- which couldn't contain the light.

After it fell with all the other broken vessels into the creation, God fixed it

and brought it up to Emanation (its original place), and God strengthened it

and gave it power to contain the light of Kindness. Therefore, Jesus being

united with the trait of Foundation and containing the light of Kindness is a

kind of pipeline for the light of Kindness to be drawn into the world.

·

This is

different from Messiah of David who is united with the Trait of Royalty and has

a different job in the world, the completion of the process. This idea of Jesus

is in conformity with the New Testament, but is very different from the

Christian idea of Jesus. Their idea of Jesus being a second giving of the Torah

seems to be totally alien to Torah theology, however Rabbi Judah Ha Levi wrote

in “the Kuzari” that both Christianity and Islam will share in the messianic

benefits as branches of Judaism and were foretold in Ezekiel 37:17. The Rambam

goes even further and says that Christianity and Islam spread the words of the

Torah and “the law of truth” over the whole world. The amazing thing is to see

how many of the major halachic authorities wrote along these same lines: Rabbenu

Gershom, Rashi, the Rashba, Rav Sheshet [in Tosphot], the Beit Joseph, the

Rema, and Rabbi Yakov Emden. [Rabbi Yaakov Emden calls Christianity the “part”

of the Torah given to the non-Jew.]

·

At the

time of the breaking of the vessels the

sefirah

of Foundation (of

Akudim) fell into the world of Creation. And then God brought it back into the

world of Emanation and drew into it the light of Kindness.

Therefore,

Jesus being unified with the trait of Foundation had in him the light of

kindness. But he was not a prophet, since he never claimed to have prophecy and

never said, “Thus sayeth the Lord”. A prophet is connected to Victory or

Splendor not to Foundation or Royalty like Messiah of Joseph or David.

·

Rabbi

Moshe Chayim Lutzato in the Ginzei Haramchal, (pg. 246) seems to be referring

to the aspect of the fall of Jesus to which Rabbi Abulafia also refers in which

Jesus, became the subject of idol-worship of the church until the Reformation

of Martin Luther.

·

That part

of the soul of Jesus (the lowest of the 4 parts) may very well have been in

hell until the time Rabbi Chayim Vital saw him rise from hell. This is like

part of the soul of Samuel which Saul spoke with.

·

It is

possible that Rabbi Abulafia is of the same opinion as Rabbi Moshe Chayim

Lutzato that Jesus fell into the evil

kelipot

and that the Gemarahs

about “that person” in fact refer to Jesus. That is the job of every righteous

person to go into the klipot and to rise therefrom, so that by his rising he

should bring all the sparks of holiness that have fallen there up with him. It

is odd the Jews and Christians agree that Jesus went into hell. Their

disagreement is on the duration of his visit and the purpose of it. They both

are looking at the same event, but from different perspectives.

·

The Sages

must have seen Jesus going into a black hole which led to the separate universe

of the Christians and never saw him arrive — just suspended in space but from

the perspective of Jesus he went in and came out of the white hole on the other

side.

·

The root

of Jesus is in the circular sephirot, therefore he is usually only accepted by

non-Jews whose roots are also there. That is why Jesus is considered bad by

Jews whose root is in the straight sepherot, for when they look at him they see

him in an area which, relative to their position in the empty space is the

klipot, but from the aspect of the circular sephirot it's the highest degree of

holiness.

·

Since

Jesus was from Joseph his holiness is hidden, “as the fish in the sea” (the

blessing given to Joseph) — and therefore the Sages of the Talmud didn't

recognize his greatness. We find that Rabbi Akiva thought Bar Kochba was the

Messiah, and he endorsed him. We find many places were the Sages admit their

fallibility. I don't see why we should attribute to them something they didn't

hold applied to them. (In fact, we see in the incident of Rabbi Eliezer that

they didn't care if God himself held differently than them. Their job, as the

saw it was to decide the law based on the majority opinion —whether that opinion

was right or wrong just didn't matter.

Yet,

according to the Torah the majority opinion can be wrong (Leviticus 4:13)

[14]

: which, according to the Talmud in

Shavuot is referring to the Sanhedrin of 71 elders permitting accidentally one

of the 36 types of sin that involve being cut off. So the majority is the way

to decide the law, not the way to discover truth.) The Talmud is a record of

the Oral Law as it was discussed and debated at that time. The Sages don't need

to be infallible in order to be deep and important just like Newton's Theory of

gravitation was deep and fruitful even though it wasn't correct --but a

necessary stage of development.

·

We need

to look at the New Testament and the Gemarah with historical retrospect and

care, but also with respect. The 57 or so New Testament documents dug up in

Egypt don't disagree on the basic facts of the life and teachings of Jesus.

When we do this, a very clear picture of the Christian sect just being another

sect besides the Scribes, Prushim (Pharisees) and Essences arises, who all had

conflicting philosophies but were all equally committed to the Oral and Written

Law.

·

Now, to

find the spiritual root of the argument between Sages of the Talmud and the

Christians, since the universes of the Jews and the Gentiles are connected by a

black hole, the Sages saw Jesus fall into the black hole, but remain on the

event horizon — while from the point of view of Jesus and the gentiles, that's

when he entered their space and the time of their correction began. Before that,

Jesus simply could have gone back in time as in the Feynman diagram.

You could

conceivably have several manifestations of a tzadik (saint) at any one time,

the one coming back (the 2nd coming is a constant process), and another that

has already returned and going about preaching (as poor man and as the son of

God coming on the wings of Heaven) (even conceivably as a good and bad one that

meet at the bottom of the “v”and 8 each other and the soul of the tzadik-saint

coming back through time losing entropy and the body going forward in time and

their meeting and disappearing into pure energy, and then in that form transversing

the realm of space-time until actually entering the black hole and disappearing

from the Jewish scene, …so in essence I'm saying the dispute between the

Christians and the Jews for the last 2000 years has been due to a lack of

imagination). This is also how its possible for many people to have the level

of Messiah the Son of Joseph through the soul of Jesus or the sparks of his

soul.

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

(The

reason the world of the Jew and gentile is connected solely by a black hole is

that the circular sephirot were drawn out into the empty space, and then

starting from the top again were drawn to the straight ones -- so basically, to

get to them you would have to go through the singularity in the center -- (which

from the aspect of the straight sephirot looks like the lowest one could sink

to -- and it appears one stays there forever), and then come out the other end

and enter into the circular sephirot, which is basically what Jesus did.

The idea

of God appearing as a person is mentioned in the Gemarah of Sannhedrin where it

says God went into a physical body at the time of Nebuchadnezzar to give him a

haircut (which most rabbis don't mention when arguing against the Trinity).

So,

theoretically there can be a world line of Moses, or any saint like so:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

So at any

one period of time the soul of a tzadik can be viewed as either good or bad (an

anti-particle), depending on where you met his world line (as the Zohar says,

“The spirit of Moses is stretched out throughout all generations”, this means

that the time-line of Moses is stretched out through all sephirot, which, to

the Ramchal is the time-line. So, I really haven't added anything new here.

A.

One progressing with the world getting older.

B.

One getting younger.

C.

One the oldest is aging to the world outside having returned from

the future.

·

Since

Jesus is united with the sepherah of Foundation which contains the light of Kindness,

it is impossible to receive the light of Kindness without some direct or

indirect connection with him. Even an unknown connection can draw that light

(even if one just says he doesn't know) -- but a total denial of him seems to

lead to wickedness.

·

Jesus

himself says that the Messiah can't be the son of David. This seems to imply in

itself that he was the Messiah from Joseph who must precede Messiah son of

David.

God promised David that the Messiah would come from his male seed.

And in general, the succession to the Crown is through the male seed as it says

in Deut. 17:20, “so that he will have length of days in his rulership, he and

his sons in the midst of Israel.” Jesus was descended from David only from his

mother's side.

·

Jesus

quoted the Torah when tempted by the evil one, “The Lord Your God You shall

fear and Him alone you shall serve.” It seems clear that Jesus believed one

must serve God alone, not Jesus. The Torah also says, “There is nothing besides

God.” Coming to this knowledge of the oneness and uniqueness of God -- loving

him and fearing him and keeping His commandments -- is what the Torah defines

as serving God.

·

Because

of the uncertainty principle, there will always be questions on Jesus or any

saint that can't be answered. Like the fall of Rome, the crusades, the

treatment of Galilio. If you believe in the Torah and the Talmud, there will be

questions you can't answer either.

·

The

Gemarah in Avodah Zara (pg. 9) says that you shouldn't buy land outside of

Israel after 470 AD, for the Redemption will have come already. It also says

the Messiah will come when the Roman Empire has spread over the whole world —

which means that the whole world known then (as they said about Achashveirosh,

that he ruled over the entire world, which was only actually the Persian

Empire).

At any

rate, the Roman Empire doesn't exist, so neither of these Gemarah's make sense

unless they are referring to Jesus. (Besides this, Rabbi Abulafia said that the

Gemarah in Sukkah regarding the Messiah son of Joseph that it  is referring to

Jesus.)

·

Jesus

being a tzadik makes it allowed to ask him for a blessing just as with any

Torah sage, as the Talmud says, “One who has someone ill at home should go to

the Torah sage in his town to pray for him.” In another place in the Talmud, it

says when a certain rabbi needed to be saved from his enemies, he went to the

graves of his parents to ask them for help [not for their prayers but for their

help].

The Sages

say that the reason the grave of Moses was not revealed is that if the Jewish

people would know where it is and go there and ask him to pray for them that

the final redemption would come right away.

·

Daniel

8:22 has to be referring to Alexander the Great (of Macedon) since in the

previous verse Daniel says the previous Empire was Media and Persia. This verse

says the empire of Alexander would be broken into four parts. I would like to

suggest that they are:

1.

Egypt under Ptolemy Soter.

2.

The Indian territories and part of Afghanistan which were given to

an Indian ruler in

return for military help.

3.

The Seleucid Empire

.

4.

Macedon.

This

would imply that the next few verses would be referring to Jesus who was in

fact at the latter time of the Greek Kingdom, after the Greeks were protected

and freed by Roman decree [so at least they could be described as a kingdom if

not an empire].

The

verses later in Daniel 11 say openly that a messiah would arise during the

empire that comes after the fall of the Greek empire and that could only be the

Roman empire. The Talmud also says that the Messiah would come only when the

Roman empire would spread over the whole world. Since the Talmud also says

about Achashvairosh that his empire spread over the entire world would mean the

whole known world at that time, this would imply that the messiah came when the

Roman Empire was at its peak, not necessarily over the whole world, but the

whole ‘known world’ at that time, which was during the rule of  Tiberius, when

the Roman Empire reached its peak.

The Roman

Catholic Church isn't the equivalent of the Roman Empire, since it existed at

the time the Talmud was written, and if the Talmud had meant the church it

wouldn't have written ‘the government’ [‘Malchus Romi’, which translated means

the government of Rome].

The whole

story there in Daniel 11 seems to be clearly talking about Julius Caesar and

Cleopatra, as has been noted before by the Jewish commentaries. And then, “AT

THAT TIME”, the redemption comes. So it seems we have to conclude that the

particular messiah it is referring to is Jesus, as Rabbi Abulafia already

concluded in his kabbalistic way. [Daniel 9 also says that the messiah would

come during the second temple period.]

·

Faith in

any saint has to be with understanding the true position and spiritual level of

that saint. Otherwise, it is possible to fall from that faith. Therefore it is

important to understand the place that Jesus takes amongst the other saints,

and not to make it to seem that he was the only one that ever existed. This

doesn't contradict the idea of the Trinity. It merely puts it into perspective.

Joseph

was the basis for the sepherah of Foundation in Emanation. Jesus is the new

basis. The change of basis matrix is:

[I used

here the four letters of Joseph's name, and the four letters of Jesus name in

Hebrew as vectors. I assumed Joseph is the first foundation (basis) and Jesus

is the new foundation. (Here I am assuming that Jesus is Foundation of

Emanation, not just of the circular sephirot, and represents a change of basis

and not just a new mapping into the circular sephirot. I don't know how to

represent that type of mapping. It seems likely that there is a connection

between this and the 4 times 4 matrix of the four Divine names: 72, 63, 45, 52.

The only connection I have ever been able to find is in the first blessing of

the Shemone Esre where Foundation is brought up to Glory which is the

sepherah

that is associated with the Divine name of four letters.)

·

One of

the arguments used against the trinity is that God can't come down to earth in

a bodily form, yet we find in the Gemarah Sa­nhedrin (95b) that he did just

that as it says there, “Rabbi Abahu said that ‘if the verse didn't write it, it

would be impossible to say’. The verse states: ‘On that day God will shave with

the razor on the other side of the river the king of Assyria, the head and the

hair of the feet and also the beard he will take away. The Holy One, Blessed is

He, came and appeared to him [Sancheriv] as an old man. He said to him, “when

you go to the kings of the east and the west, what will you say?” He answered,

“I am also worried about this, what should we do?” He said, “Go and disguise

yourself.” He asked, “how should I do that?” He said, “go bring me a scissors

and I'll give you a haircut”. “From where should I get it?” “Go into that house

over there.” He went and found some ministering angles who appeared to him as

men and they were grinding date seeds. He said “give me a scissor”. They said

“first grind one seed and well give you a pair”. By the time he got back it was

already dark. He said “bring a lamp” he went and got one. As he was coming a

spark touched his beard and his beard caught fire. He came and he gave him a

hair cut. Rav Papa said that explains the common saying “if you singe an

Assyrian and he liked it burn his beard also.”

I can

imagine many will think that this Gemara doesn't mean this literally, however,

that is not so since Rabbi Abahu said, “If the verse didn't say this it would

be impossible to say.” Now, if the whole story is just a parable, then it would

be possible to say. Rather, Rabbi Abahu is saying that this verse is saying

something so contrary to reason that if it didn't say it, it would be

impossible to say, i.e., that God himself came down to Earth in a physical body

to give Sancheriv a haircut.

The Zohar

has nothing to compare with this except that it says (vol 3, pg. 240): even

though it is not the way of God to eat and drink, for the love of the Jewish

people, God eats and drinks.

Incidentally,

I think the Gemara in Sanhedrin it refers to is the sepherah called “Tiferet” [Beauty],

since the Zohar usually refers to that particular sepherah by the same language

that the Gemara used, i.e., “the Holy One, Blessed Be He”.

[Perhaps

there is a hint for this idea in Genesis. For it says,  “a man fought with

Jacob”, and later the man said “you have fought with God and with men”, and

when asked his name he refused to identify himself and later Jacob called the

place “The Face of God, for he said ‘I have seen God face to face and my soul

was saved’”. [This is the literal translation.] Later, the Prophet Hoshea said

about this that God appeared to him and served him. [

Hoshea

12:3-6]

Now, the

sages have a different idea of what happened there, and said it referred to the

angel of Esau — which really isn't a problem, for the simple explanation is that

God contains all aspects good and evil for there is nothing besides him. Now,

if that was God in human form, who we usually refer to as Jesus, it is in fact

interesting that Jesus became the intercessor of Esau [Rome]. It is assumed in

general that God refers in general to the aspect of God that is above all time

and space, but also to each individual level that is one step  higher that the

previous, which contains the light of God relative to that previous level.

As the

Sages said about the Tana who explained every Hebrew word

ET

in the

Torah as a

ribui

— including something else — when he got to the verse

that says, “‘

Et’

the Lord your God you shall fear”, he stopped. For what

could that

ET

possibly include?

Until

Rabbi Akiva came and explained, “‘

Et

the Lord your God you shall fear’,

to include disciples of the wise.”]

[This

idea that God is each immediate higher level is actually hinted at in the Torah,

where Abraham said to Avimelech, “the gods tricked me into leaving my father’s

home” i.e., the set of all the spiritual levels up to God].

I know

that the two major themes of the Old Testament are that there is only One God

and to Him alone it is proper to pray and serve. And the other being that the

Jewish people are the chosen people forever and that this will never change.

However, the idea that we need an intermediary is also there, from the

blessings of the Patriarchs to the requests of the people to the prophets.

Thus, I

would like to suggest that the level to which no intermediary is necessary  is

the level immediately above one called Elohim which is the set of all those

levels. But to God as he is really is above time space and conception [that is

represented by the ineffable Name], apparently we do need some help

approaching. I don't mean that we can't approach Him directly because obviously

we can, but rather that it helps to have a little help.

Why else

do we do the

mitzvot

? Because God said to. Well, God also said about the

angel he was sending before the Jewish people, “Don't disobey him for my Name

is in him.” So here, God himself has indicated the significance of an

intermediary. (“Other gods” are other levels not attached to the “rope of

holiness”, i.e., that are not manifestations of God.)

[In every

generation, there were and will always be one part of the Torah that will be

politically incorrect. The Rambam made a somewhat reactionist theology against

Christianity but the simple way the sages look at the Torah is thus, as I have

written. E.g., when they explained that God called Jacob ‘God’ as

Rashi

brings down in

Genesis

that would seem to go against the Rambam that you

can't call a person God [the

Raavad

in fact disagreed with the Rambam

and held that believing that God was or can be manifested in a body is not

against the Torah].

The

Rambam obviously was embarrassed by many laws of the Torah that seem to go

against reason, and he had to create a rationalization for them. Nowadays,

other parts of the Bible bother us, e.g., when God promises to give the land of

Israel to the children of Abraham and then Ishmael is born and God promises to

Abraham that Ishmael will fear God.

Now,

slavery of the Bible is embarrassing to the Jews, and the fact that the Bible

says you have to go to the rabbis to understand the Torah correctly is embarrassing

to the Christians. Now, legally speaking, the slavery of the Torah is actually

seldom, or indentured servants — because there are strict laws of how to treat

a slave, and in fact the Russians were doing a lot better as serfs under the

Tzar than when they were emancipated and toppled the Tzar and created a

communist state.

Now what

was God doing wrestling with Jacob? If we say that was the aspect of God that

contains evil then this is understood. Or just the opposite. Perhaps it was the

good aspect of God fighting with the evil aspect of Jacob. For Jacob contained

all the future Jewish souls many of which are not good.

It could

also refer to chaos and correction, i.e., God represents the higher world of

chaos [63] and Jacob, correction [45] as it usually is thus in

Kabbalah

anyway and the wrestling is the vessels of correction trying to contain the

light of chaos until the dawn, i.e., the rising of the light of the name 72.

I think

the real explanation is that  first Yaacob had to fight God [good] and then

evil Esau which is what every person has to go through in order to come to that

level of God — beyond space-time and conception.

For a

person to come what he must come to he first has to fight evil, then he has to

fight God, and then becomes a man. [There is a certain point a person needs to

come to, a critical mass, so to speak, for him to start to wake up.]

This is

represented by the fact that God put the fiery angels before the path to Gan

Eden. For one must go through Hell and Heaven to come to the

Tree of Life

.

The angels try to stop one and then if they don't succeed they use their sword.

God here

also represents Being [the right

sepherah

Kindness], and Esau non-being

[the left

sepherah

, lack of light]. Jacob had to fight both to come to

“Becoming” [the middle

sepherah

,

Yod

He

Vav

He

.]

This is the significance of the wrestling, i.e., the joining of Jacob's level

[right] with Esau's level [left] to come to the middle [Torah].

The

reason Infinite God is sometimes manifested in finite space and time, as with

Jesus, or in the Temple, or in other ways, is to give the finite intelligence

of man some grasp of Him and thus to become attached to Him which is the

purpose of man’s creation. Since there are five levels of man's soul, each manifestation

of God is to give man a grasp of a higher infinity [as the difference between

all the numbers between 0 and 1 and all the numbers between 0 and 2]. As the:

1.

Temple [inanimate]

2.

The Waters: “The spirit of God hovered on the

face of the Waters”.

3.

The Chayot: “I the Chayot that I had see on

the river Cevarand, on it was the Presence of God. (Chayot can mean animal in

Hebrew). It refers to a type of angel that is the higher spirit of the animal

kingdom.

4.

Jesus. “Also, the Presence spoke through the

mouth of Moses”.

5.

God also spoke frequently in the Bible

through an angel to reveal His Infinity to the highest level of man, the

Yechida.

·

One of

the arguments I have heard against Jesus is that the three requirements of the

Messiah were not fulfilled by him, i.e., the three requirements the Rambam

gives: of building the Temple, returning all Israel to the 613 commandments,

and gathering the dispersed of Israel.

However

we find that these things are the subject of a debate in the Gemara, Sanhedrin

98a. Rabbi Yochanan in fact says like the Rambam that all the promises of the

prophets are for the days of the messiah while the higher spiritual world we

can't comprehend. Shmuel says that all the promises are in fact for the higher

spiritual world while the only difference between his time [under Babylonian

rule] and the time of the messiah will be the subjection of the nations on

Israel.

That is

in fact probably what would have happened if they had accepted the teachings of

Jesus [since it was the hot headed nationalists then who provoked the wrath of

the Romans and the subsequent exile. But any savior can't do his job unless he

is believed in. Even Moses could do nothing with the many people that didn't believe

in him, as the sages said that only

1/5

th

or

1/50

th

of

Israel came out of Egypt since the rest God caused to die during the seven days

of darkness, since they didn't believe in Moses.

[So in a

way, Moses brought a worse Holocaust on the Jewish people than the Nazis since

the Nazis never got up to killing 88% or 98% of the Jewish people. So we see

being a savior isn't enough. The people have to accept the savior. And if they

don't, woe to them]. And if no one had believed, Moses in fact could not have

saved anyone — as he told God his reason for not wanting to go, “They won't believe

in me.” And, in fact, his promise to bring that generation into Israel would

have been a false prophecy if not for the two people of the generation that did

believe in him all the way: Calev Ben Yefune and Hoshea Ben Nun.

But at

any rate God's purpose will not be thwarted totally, and we find with the

introduction of the Magna Carta in the beginning of the 6th millennium when God

did promise the redemption, that the yoke of the nations has slowly been lifted

off Israel, who are now able to live in relative freedom compared to the chaos

and suffering under the Romans and the Dark Ages.

In fact,

I think that it is possible that Shmuel was referring to messiah of Joseph and

Rabbi Yochanan to the messiah from David. And, in fact this is hinted at by the

Rambam who brings the statement of Shmuel also, so apparently, he felt that it

is possible to reconcile those statements. This, however is not like the gemara

which says openly that Rabbi Yochanan and Shmuel disagree.

·

One of

the other objections I have heard against Jesus is that his teachings disagree

with that of the Sages: however I have found that not to be correct, e.g.,

Jesus held that a saint has the power to forgive sin as it says in

masechta

Rosh Hashanah

17b, God forgives the sin of many for the sake of the one and

also we find, Moses prayed to God, “forgive their sin and if not, wipe me out

of your book”.

·

Another

objection I have heard is that Jesus put good character traits above doing the

commandments. This would in fact be a legitimate complaint if not that all the

later Sages of Israel agreed with it. The Chafetz Chayim wrote in Shmirat

HaLashon that good character comes first as it says in the verse, “To walk in

his ways and to keep his commandments,” and he brings another statement from

the sages, that the first thing a verse mentions is first in importance before

the later thing — and, this verse specifically is referring to kindness and

compassion. The Kabbalist Rashash says, along these lines in

Nahar Shalom,

that character is the basic soul of a person, while the commandments are only

the garments of the soul. The Gra says things along these lines throughout his

books.

·

We find

in Sanhedrin 104b, that the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah wanted to count King

Solomon among those who have no portion in the next world. Different echoes

came to indicate to them that they were wrong until eventually they changed

their minds. My question is if this body of Sages which included the three last

prophets could make a mistake about King Solomon, couldn't the later Sages of

subsequent generations make similar mistakes. Now, the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah

were so great that God kept trying to convince them of their mistake until they

finally gave in, but who says that God would do that with later sages?

·

One of

the objections I have heard against Jesus is that the Sanhedrin of the time

killed him. But, the Talmud says that Herod killed all the Rabbis of the Pharisees

who had

Semichah,

and there was left only one Rabbi, Baba Ben Buta — that

was when Jesus was only a year old or so. So, when Jesus was about thirty, how

could the Sanhedrin have very many true rabbis on it. Where could they have

come from, except the Sadducees. Anyway, we find opinions among the Christian

scholars that Scribes in the New Testament was changed from the original word ‘Sadducees’.

[In the Greek, they are very close. At the time the disciples of Paul were

editing the documents to be included in the New Testament the Sadducees were on

good terms with them and the scribes and pharisees had become enemies.

·

[On the

subject of the stirring dirt and water on Shabbat that Jesus did, cf. Beitza, Chapter

4, in the Rosh [Rabbainu  Asher]. Jesus held like Rashi in that Rosh.

·

On the

subject of washing the hands, Jesus held like the Gemara in Chulin and the

Zohar that the first washing before eating is a mitzvah not an obligation, or

he depended on the washing from the morning. He also held like the

Yerushalmi

in

Zeraim

and the

Gemara

in

Suchah

that the Sages don't

have the authority to uproot anything from the Torah even for a positive

command. The

Gemara

in

Succah

holds that we don't put off a

mitzvah of the Torah for a rabbinical decree as it says, “we don't take the

lulav

on the first day of

yom tov

that falls on

Shabbat,

because we

don't know the exact first calculation for

Rosh Chodesh

[the new moon]. Thus

if we did, we would take it in despite of the rabbinical decree of Rabbah, of ‘perhaps

he will carry it four amot in a public domain’”. The Rif states the Gemara in

Succah for the halacha, so he holds the same way. See the Ritvah in chapter 4

of Rosh Hashanah.

·

The Greek

word for picking corn also implies rubbing it between one’s fingers, which is

permitted on the Shabbat. It just seems like Jesus and his disciples

encountered on the Shabbat ultra-religious Jews who were ignorant of the

halachah as happens all the time with people that are super religious — they

always keep on adding restriction upon restriction. I have seen many times

people doing perfectly permitted things on the Sabbath and getting  attacked by

the ultra-orthodox, who simply didn't know the halachah — and even when the

Shulchan Aruch [Code of Jewish Law] was brought out to show them, they wouldn't

believe it.

It is

also interesting to note that Jesus said the same idea as the Rambam in

The

Guide

. Jesus said the Shabbat was given for man. The Rambam wrote that the

object of the entire Torah, in general, is the well-being of the body and the

soul — and specifically, the Shabbat was given to witness the fact that God

created the world, and to give man rest and comfort.

[Moreh

NevuchimIII:27, 43]

Couldn't

it have been “

hora’at sha’ah

” [a need of the hour], as the Rambam

explains about Eliyahu the prophet on Mount Carmel? For, to the Rambam Eliyahu

didn't sacrifice there because he received a prophecy allowing it, rather

because of the general principle of “

hora’at sha’ah

”.

In the

War Rule 5:1-5 of the Dead Sea Scrolls, according to the translation of Robert Eisenman

and Schiffman it says, “as it is written in the Book of Isaiah the prophet”,

“The thickets of the forest shall be hacked away with iron and the Lebanon

trees in their majesty shall fall. But a shoot shall grow out of the stump of

Jesse, [a twig shall sprout from his stoke [Isaiah 10:34 and 11:1] a shoot of

David, and they will be judged, the... and the prince of the congregation will

kill him, the army of… with drums and dances. And the high priest commanded…

the corpses of the Kittim”.

Here is

mentioned the fact that there were a few verses of Isaiah that we don't have in

the present day Isaiah. These verses clearly speak about a messiah that will be

killed by the ruler of the people and sanctioned by the high priest and armies

of the Kittim, i.e. the Romans, according to the Targum Unkelos. This explains

references that Jesus and Paul made to verses predicting his death that we

don't have in our present day Bible.

·

A further

objection I have heard is against the virgin birth. Christians usually bring a

proof to the virgin birth from Isaiah 7:14. Jewish people arguing against them

point out that the word “

almah

” doesn't mean a virgin but a young girl.

However, the   Jewish commentary, the

Even Ezra

explains, “It is

probable that it means virgin or a girl who has had sex,” i.e., either one is

equally likely. [Besides that, one could always answer from the verse in Genesis

that the Sons of God came in unto the daughters of man and they gave birth.]

·

One

important proof of Jesus is very simple. If physics would teach people to be

good and those that learned it would be not good then we would have a question

about its validity. But now that it teaches about physical reactions and those

reactions occur as it predicts, then we have no question. Now, since the Talmud

teaches people to be good and the people that learn it are not good, we have a

question about its validity. To throw it out is not possible since the Bible

itself says that the rabbis alone have the authority to interpret it. Thus, we

have to figure out what is wrong with the Talmud.

Many

solutions have been offered. As we see in Israel, none work. Based on every

solution that is offered there is a yeshiva/s built on that principle. None of

the results of those solutions come out particularly better or worse than

anyone else. Jesus is left as the only viable option who has had success for

2000 years of inspiring countless hospitals, orphanages etc, and taming violent

civilizations and people.

·

To a

degree,  it is possible to accept the idea of the Trinity [since it is the job

of every person to be one with God and we assume a true saint has succeeded in

that job].

Thus,

Christ was the infinite God coming into finite limits in order that finite man

could have some concept of God. This is the reason for the manifestation of God

in all the places in the bible [like the Temple, or at Mount Sinai, or by an

angel], where he limits himself in time and space.

This is

to give the human mind the ability to expand. The human nefesh [life force] can

receive the light of God on the level of faith [alpha 0, the first type of

infinity]. The spirit can receive the light of beauty [alpha 1, the second

infinity]. Jesus was to allow the second infinity to permeate the consciousness

of Man. Rabbi Nachman is for the soul to receive the light of the next type of

infinity, Understanding.

Chapter 2 - Christianity

·

Western

civilization grew on the ruins of the Roman Empire, since, according to Rabbi

Abulafia, the vertical part of the cross signifies Hebrew and the horizontal

part Latin and Greek. Therefore Christendom which had to contain all these

three elements in order to become Western civilization, is significantly

different than the rest of the world which remains in the Dark Ages until they

become westernized.

·

Christianity

just got too moral, and secularism just has got too immoral after Kant.

Nowadays, we base laws on science which are unproven and unfounded and only

barely out of the crib. Christianity has to first throw out all the laws of the

Bible, as Paul said to do. Then they have to make up their own morality.

Secularism first throws out the Bible, then logic and reason

as per Kant

.

Then they have to find their own things to fight like tobacco. (I would guess

that alcohol kills a lot more people on the road than tobacco but America found

out then the wise statement of Einstein, “You can't make illegal what people

are going to do anyway.”) I don't know the reason God forbade certain things in

the Bible and permitted others, but I suspect He knew what He was doing.

·

The path

to knowledge for the Jew and Christian has apparently taken the long and hard

paths. Getting out of religious thought and going to Aristotle and humanism

seems to have done much more for knowledge in general. Yet Jesus and Baba Sali

are also realities I must resort to the idea of drawing the light of the

circular sephirot (humanism) into the vessels of correction (Jewish people) Jewish

soul).

·

In the

opinion of the Meiri and the Rashba Christians aren't idol worshippers but in

the category of gerai toshav [proseleties of the gates] . In the opinion of

Rabbi Joseph Karo they are Gerai Hashaar (proselytes of the gate) which is on

even a higher level than gerai toshav (proselytes of dwelling who have legal

status and rights in Judaism though they aren't Jewish, since they keep the

seven Noaide laws) Rabbi Yaakov Emden writes “Christianity has been given to

the Gentile world by the Apostles as part of the Jewish religion and its

founder has made the moral laws stricter than those contained in the law of

Moses.”

·

Rabbi

Nachman said when one starts to come into the realm of holiness, judgements are

awoken against him. Thus, you could explain the problems Rome had after

accepting Jesus, from that aspect.

This

would also explain the problems the world had at each stage a new knowledge

came into the world, “He who increases knowledge, increases pain.” [Proverbs]

·

1666 was the year of the discovery of the Law

of Gravity of Issac Newton and simultaneously the year of plague in London.

·

Special and General Relativity;

·

World War I/II and Quantum Theory

·

The Renaissance and the plague.

·

The Kabbalah and the expulsion from Spain.

·

Chasidut and the Napoleonic wars.

This is

because each new development is the result of two opposites reacting together

so the new synthesis comes out a new and improved product. But, the residue of

this process is Judgements.

It seems

possible to predict from this —now that the world is coming to a new age of

consciousness that some Judgements also will be awoken.

In  a

different section I have written what I think may help, specifically the five

parshiot Rabbi Nachman said that help for this.

·

Jesus

emphasizes private prayer, loving all people — religious or not — emphasizing

kindness and righteous action. He sounds more like Socrates than the Pope. And

while I'm at it why not mention that these were the things the kabbalists

emphasized too. (And all the great sages of Israel, e.g. Rebbi Sar Shalom the

Kabbalist, the Chafetz Chayim, the Baal Shem Tov, the Gra, Rabbi Nachman, etc. Doesn't

that mean that all these people understood something that they just couldn't

convey to their disciples.)

·

The basic

reason that Christianity isn't idolatry is that, at first there were no kings,

just gods at the head of each people. As many different peoples there were, that's

how many gods there were.

The

Christians, accepting and worshiping the God of Israel, are by definition not

idol worshipers, whether they believe Jesus was God in human form or not. This,

of course, the Meiri and the Rashba and other Medieval authorities noticed

before me, and gave Christians the category of Gerey Toshav [proselytes of the

gates], not idolaters.

·

In the

old Kabbalah we find prayers addressed to the sephirot [traits] of God. We find

an Amora going to the grave of his father saying, “Save me! Save me!” — from his

enemies. We ask the angels for blessings on Friday night.

At what

point does praying to a trait of God not constitute idolatry and  to a stone yes?

Aren't they both creations of God?

The

Rambam explains that the prohibition on idolatry refers to the way idolatry

originally started — that is, the generation of Enosh saw the stars in Heaven,

and reasoned that since God has attributed honor to these creations it is right

that we do so also, and so they started worshiping them.

Since the

main prohibition of idolatry is dependent on the intention, if one prays to

something thinking of it as a creation separate from God it is idolatry. But if

he prays to it knowing that it is only a

manifestation

of God it is not.

[Though

this above idea may seem strange to many people however we find Rava in the

Gemara [and the Rambam hold as law] that even if one bows down to a statue for

love or fear of the statue, he hasn't transgressed the prohibition of idolatry

until he accepts it as a god, i.e. he believes it to have a separate existence

besides God.

If a

person would believe that God has put his name on a stone, [i.e., he believes

the stone is a manifestation of God and has no separate power or existence

besides God], even though this is a mistake, and that person bows down to the

stone, it isn't idol worship legally since in his mind, he is worshiping God.

[In the

language of the Gemara, “He didn't accept the stone for godliness”.] It isn't

even “Shogag” [accidental] since the prohibition depends on the thought. That

is why going to the graves of the saints or bowing down in front of a Torah

scroll isn't idol worship, since the people that do so believe that God has

placed His name on that thing.

This

explains why many of the first authorities held that the Christians aren't idol

worshipers. This also explains why the desire for money is actual idolatry [to

all the Sages of Chasidut]. This is idolatry, since even the people that do

this don't believe that God has placed his Name on the money. So, we can see

from this that even the Catholic Church isn't doing actual idolatry with the

statues, even though they are still forbidden from the verses that specifically

say not to make molten images.

However,

the Rambam holds differently than this, and he believes that thinking that one

needs any kind of middle-man between one and the Creator is idolatry.

This has

to be understood in context — for to the Rambam there is a higher plane than

Good and evil, that is Truth and falsehood, and the great evil of idolatry is

that it is falsehood.

What

makes it worse than other mistakes is that it depends on what one makes a

mistake about. Making a mistake about mundane things isn't so bad as making a

mistake about God. However, most authorities, even in the Talmud don't hold

this way, and until this day it is the custom of Jews everywhere to go to their

holy men for a blessing.

And even

the Rambam can't get away from the middleman for he says, [

The Guide

III:52], that the Intellect is the middleman between one and God. [You can't

complain about the Rambam speaking about every mitzvah being a middleman. For

he would say every mitzva isn't to attach you to God but to give you the right

opinions].

·

The prohibition of

idolatry

is to serve any of the creations of God, not a prohibition

to pray or ask a favor

from any creation, while knowing that it is in God's hands, for we ask saints

for a blessing, and we go to a bakery to ask for bread, and on the night of the

Shabbat we ask the angels to bless us.

·

I heard

from Issac Ram that the catholic church has the spirit of Jesus even though

they are idolatry. The more liberal denominations of the church are like the

meeting place between Western thought and Jesus, but the spirit of Jesus is

really there only in trace amounts.

Chapter 3 - Paul

·

The

disciples of Jesus who knew Jesus whom Jesus chose (as he said “I have chosen

you”) suspected that Paul was telling people not to keep the commandments, and

sent for him. And he came to Jerusalem and defended himself saying; that he was

only telling non-Jews that they didn't have to become Jewish to be saved, but

he never told Jews not to keep the commandments. And even did commandments in

Jerusalem in front of people to prove that he was observant. Then again later

the disciples became suspicious and sent Peter to see what was going on. As it

turned out, their suspicion was correct as we see in Paul's letters.

[The

letters  were written over several years and perhaps represent Paul's later

ideas, but they still give us the basic gist of Paul's ideas - which the true

disciples of Jesus had made clear was totally against the true doctrines of

Jesus - and they threatened to excommunicate him if he would teach such false

teachings, which as it turned out he actually did teach. However it may be that

Paul held like Rashi in Macot 24 (“The righteous shall live by his faith”), so

I think Paul is legitimate.

However,

his hatred of the Law seems to have simply replaced the laws of God of the old

Testament with new meaningless rituals of the Catholic church. I just don't see

a point to attacking the laws of the Torah to the extent that he does. I guess

he wanted to emphasize the importance of loving the tzadik, and that that is

the only hope of salvation but  that doesn't seem to me to justify attacking

God's laws.

·

In his

letter to the Galatians [Gal. 2:6, in 57AD] he wrote about the disciples of

Jesus who were the leaders of the church in Jerusalem, “those people who are

acknowledged as leaders - not that their importance matters to me.” In 2

Corinthians 11:3-4 he acknowledges that the disciples of Jesus were teaching

about “another Jesus” different from the one he was teaching about. But I admit

the disciples in Jerusalem also don't come out looking so well: Annanis and his

wife after giving all their possessions to the community don't seem to me to be

guilty of the death penalty for keeping a few things for themselves.

Chapter 3 – Jews and

Christians

·

“I

testify that whether a man or woman, slave or maid servant, Jew or

idol-worshiper, the Divine Presence rests on a person only according to his

deeds”

-Tana Deve Eliyahu,

from Eliyahu the prophet. “For it is known

that the souls of Israel are from the earth… but as for the non-Jewish nations

whose souls are from Heaven, they need not perform deeds (613

mitzvot

.)”

-- The Gaon from Vilna (The Gra.) Commentary on

Shir HaShirim,

Chap. 1,

Verse 6.

According

to Rabbi Shneur Zalman (The Baal HaTanya) (in Parshas VaYishlach) the root of

Esav is from worlds higher than Yaakov (Tohu) and that is why Isaac wanted to

bless him, but the mistake of Isaac was in not realizing that Esau had fallen

from that root.

I think

to answer the contradiction between the Gra and the Baal HaTanya that the world

the Kings of Edom in the straight sephirot must somehow have a connection with

the circular ones.

At any

rate I didn't know from where the Gra and the Baal Hatanya got this from until

I saw in

Shaar Ruach HaKodesh: Yichud 10

on the verse, “These are the

three Children of Noah” which basically gives as the root of the children of

Noah the Three Divine Names of 161, 143, and 151. But the support for the Baal

HaTanya’s point of view is the fact that in the same letters are hinted the

name

Elohim

with the

yud

filling the letters. Even though that is

wholly important to note that it is the later permutations of that name which

give rise to the

Klipot,

it seems to me that the root of non-Jews is the

three names, “I Will Be” in the eye of Adam Kamdon, not actually the full names

of 161 ,143, and 151 respectively, for in the full names there are no circular sephirot,

[unless we are referring to the circular sephirot before Adam Kadmon]. But in

Adam Kadmon, the circular sephirot are only in the three names Ehyeh in the

dots of the 63, or the forehead, which is anyway the root of Israel and not

relevant to this discussion.

According

to this idea, the explanation of the fact the three names Ehyeh take the 22

letters and make vessels from them would refer to the letters of the other

languages and this fits with the idea of the Baal Hatanya’s that the letters of

other languages also have holiness.

Now a

hint to the Gra is the fact that the Torah blesses the children of Abraham and

Issac to be like the stars of the heavens but the children of Yaakov like the

dust of the Earth. Now even though the blessing for Abraham of being like the

stars certainly goes for the Jewish people as we see in exodus 32:13, still

that blessing clearly goes on all the other children of Abraham and Issac,

[i.e., the Christian and Muslim people].

·

Rabbi

Issac Luria said the Jewish people have their root in the drops of semen that

Adam spilled during those 130 years after the sin and were born again as people

and sinned because of the rust still attached to them and had to go through the

purification process of the flood, the dispersion, and the Egyptian exile. This

may sound pretty bad; however, the root of Israel in the Higher worlds is from

Wisdom, but since they were supposed to be the children of Adam they came out

with his seed. Rabbi Nachman says the descendants of Moses have even a higher

root than that. At any rate, the root of the Jewish people is from the worlds

of correction but have had to go through a difficult purification process.

·

Rabbenu

HaKadosh said to Antonious that the promise to destroy Esau only refers to

those that hold onto the deeds of Esau. The Gemara also says that any who do

not believe in idolatry is called Jewish. In the Rambam’s enumeration of the 13

principles, we find that he says that anyone who believes in these principles

comes into the category of “Israel” even if they do as many evil deeds as they

possibly can - and anyone who does not believe in them is not Jewish. Thus, I

find in the Gemara and the Rambam the idea that whether one is considered

Jewish is not necessarily dependent on conversion or if one's mother was

Jewish, but rather it depends on one's principles and deeds. It is possible to

ignore the Gemara since it can be explained as just a

drasha

(not

halacha) but the Rambam who draws on these Gemaras clearly means his statement

to be taken as halacha...

What if

we take the drashot of the gedolai hachasidut that clearly held that the desire

for money is in the halachic category of idolatry to its natural conclusion?

Does this exclude Jewish people with the desire for money from the category of

Israel? Is now Mother Theresa and Princess Diana Jewish because they engaged in

deeds of loving kindness - [The other mitzvot, they were not obligated in since

Rashi says we should not do all the 613 any more since it would lead to no one

meriting to the next world.] Clearly, other first authorities besides the Rambam

would not hold like this since they held that the Jewish and nonJewish soul are

different.Now there is a debate as to where the Rambam lived in a spiritual

sence.Some hold in Jerusalem and others hold in Athens.I think his feet where

in Jerusalem but his head was in Athens,ie. he obviously had a vision as to

what determined a persons Jewishness was how attached to God he is.But to get

from the halacha to there ,i don't think he knew, but rather he felt

intuitively was correct. And this may apply in general for he certainly wanted

to bridge between reason and the Law, but I don't think he really knew exactly

how.

I think

the Kabbalah provides the answer to all these questions. For clearly the

mitzvot contain only the holiness of the vessels, not of the inner light which

depends on many factors, e.g., if God wants to put his light into it for that

person at that time. In a similar manner Jewish people have only the holiness

of the body, not of the spirit unless any particular persons happens to merit

to it. Now the Rambam holds that the holiness of the spirit comes from faith in

the 13 principles and so in his opinion anyone Jewish or otherwise believing in

these principles is spiritually Jewish.

·

Jesus had

the vessel of

tikun

and the light of love from

tohu

, so non-Jews

feel more affinity towards him than Jews since he contains the light of their

higher root.

The root

of the Jewish people is in the

sepherah

of Royalty which is the daughter

of Wisdom so they are usually more into good ideas (or bad ones when they fall

from their root). The root of Jesus is in the sepherah of Foundation which is

filled with the light of kindness so Christians are more into good deeds (or

bad ones when they fall from their root.) The amount of hospitals and general

help of the Catholic church for mankind for the last 2000 years is nothing less

than awesome. Similarly the amount of study and books of the Jewish people for

their history is also awesome.

·

Tana

DeBay Eliyahu, “whether a man or a woman, a slave or a maidservant, a Jew or an

idol -worshipper, the Holy Spirit rests on a person according to their deeds.”

At first

non-Jews had a soul from the outside of the

klipah

even their good

inclination is from the klipah. But when they began to believe the one God they

drew a higher holiness on themselves from their higher root. This applies to

non-Jewish nations as a whole also, for every nation is like a whole person

with some people representing the head and some the hands and others the heart

and others the soul.

·

The

reason God brought Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart was to create music that would

tie ones soul to the higher

sephirah

(divine trait). That is Bach -

glory, Mozart - kindness, Beethoven - Judgment, Handel - Royalty.

Incidentally,

Beethoven did intend his music to be specifically ethnic which for Germany and

Austria is the trait of judgment and it is only softened by the belief in Jesus

but after they threw out Jesus in the 1860s the basic ethnic philosophy of

Germany took it's place, i.e., war and conquest.

·

The

reason a non-Jew is not allowed to keep the Sabbath is that he is not effected

by the Shabbos-field energy. Jews are affected only by the straight sephirot

energy field, and non-Jews are affected only by the circular sephirot field.

Each one of the 10 sephirot has its own energy field. There are certain sephirot

that draw wisdom or children etc. And there are combinations of the fields of

the sephirot that draw different combinations of blessings.

A field

is usually created or drawn by what one occupies himself with. So if one for

instance learns math he will usually draw upon himself the math field energy.

Kindness draws a kindness field. Learning Gemarah brings its particular field

energy. Evil has its energy also. A place or country has its energy. Every day

has its own energy. The reason to be by Rabbi Nachman on Rosh Hashanah is there

is a certain energy field around a tzadik and every special day has it's own

energy field. So on Rosh Hashanah when the two combine and there is created a

electromagnetic oscillation by the presence of the chasidim, and a spiritual

electro-magnetic wave is created.

Many

times one can't help what type of field is drawn upon him or how he will be

affected by it. He can just try his best to do what is right. But general

principles can fail in specific situations and therefore God has given us a

certain intuition in the heart to be able to detect energy fields not seen by

the eye or detected by the mind.

·

It seems

to me that the world points defined by place and time are only approximations

as in General Relativity and it's really only the properties of the field

around one determine his spirituality and closeness with God. As Rebbi said to

Antoninus, “Esau, but not all Esau”, i.e., what the Torah says in general is

only an approximation unless it says “all”. Of course the idea of the

mitzvot

is to draw the field energy. Every family has its specific energy field around

it.

·

There is

a disagreement among the first authorities if the Jewish and gentile soul is

the same thing. The other authorities say there is a difference in the souls

and this opinion I have followed in this book since it is of Rabbi Luria also.

·

Thought

in Judaism follows a parallel path to that of their neighbors (but they add a

Jewish touch and talent to it), since non-Jews are from Tohu which is above

Tikun which is the root of the Jewish people. For example after the Romans

codified their laws in Justinian's reign, the Jews codified their's in the same

period.

·

Since the

western Catholic Church followed rationalistic tendencies, so did the Jews in

western Europe and in Catholic lands like Poland and Lithuania. (The hard

headed rationalism of Jews from those areas is quite famous.) Since the split

of the Roman Empire Constantinople and the Eastern Church followed mystical

tendencies and subsequently when the Muslims took over that area they

incorporated the same ideas in the Sufi. And so we shouldn't be surprised to

find Sephardic Jewry from Islamic lands and Russian Jewry (who lived in lands

under the Eastern Church) having strong mystical tendencies. The Kabbalah

originates in fact in Islamic Spain before it was conquered by the

Christians.When Martin Luther broke away from the church and said one needs

only faith not reason, this same idea became the prevalent pattern in Western

Jewry also until nowadays. The clear opinion of the authorities and even the

great saints of Chasidut that one needs to combine Faith and reason has been

forgotten. Rabbi Nachman held Faith was the main thing, but he clearly held one

needs reason also.

Jewish

music from Islamic lands is totally Arabic in character. The yeshivot are the

Jewish version of the monastery, and this is why they only existed in Catholic

lands, not in Russia (except a brief attempt before World War I), or in Islamic

lands. Jewish music of European Jewry is almost an exact duplicate of Ukrainian

music.

The

ethical system of the

Duties of the Heart

(which is the basis of the

ethical system of Judaism) is almost identical to the system of Christian

authors who were about 200 years before it. -(Those same authors provided the

Islamic thinkers with their system also. However this isn't to say that Jews

aren't creative or original, but their special power is that of integration

-i.e. the welding together is disparate ideas to come out with a result where

the whole is more and better than the parts.

It is

obvious that we see a case of the dialectics of Hegel, i.e., the Jewish people

representing one principle and each non-Jewish nation representing another

principle and their interacting to create a new synthesis which then further

interacts. But the Kabbalah would explain it differently - that the non-Jewish

nations have fallen from their higher root in Tohu [ which comes from the

Divine Name of Numerical value 63] and need  to rise there and the Jewish

people  need to draw that light of Tohu into their vessels.

CONCLUSION

Now

science, I have been saying throughout this book, is on the level of

understanding higher than any religion. However there also the degree of

goodness is dependent on the closeness to the origin, not how high one can

climb. This can however be the subject of debate. Some people may want to put

Judaism at the top others Christianity others science and still others kabbalah.

I don't want to enter that debate for I think it is irrelevant as to determine

one's degree of good or evil or horizontal closeness with God. But it does

determine vertical closeness.]

[Now I

have in this put all systems to the left of the

y

axis and said goodness

refers to closeness to the axis. However it is possible that in fact the column

of infinite light is in the exact center between good and evil, I tend to this

that is the case and that is the reason secular People tend to be closer to God

than religious. In the vertical order I think the vessels of evangelical

Christianity are on foundation of Tohu (since they are from Tohu Chaos which is

a higher level than the vessels of correction) But only if it stays pure for

the higher something is if it falls, it falls lower than other things. The

reason I think this is Jesus being a prelude to redemption contained a higher

vessel than Judaism which remained one rung back. However in terms of the

light, the light of correction-Torah is higher.]

But since

the correction involves taking the broken vessels of tohu and fixing them and

creating one large vessel it would make sense to do that with the different

systems and then drawing into them the light of the name 45 the Torah. Rabbi

Nachman holds that the name 52 is a measure of the entropy of the universe

“Science”

has come to pervade human thought. In the 1800s it undermined the authority of

the Bible, and certainly of the Talmud. It also affected faith in that it

became a rival faith. The objective achievements of “science” along with the

weakness of Christianity to check violence, impressed the common man, and led

him to believe in the new faith of “science”. Respect for it grew in proportion

to its achievements. “Science” has already pervaded every aspect of human life

while religion has failed in its major objective of understanding the basic

meaning of life.

“Science”

became a religion. It became the messiah. It was thought to provide answers for

metaphysical questions and all social problems. [While philosophy became the

proponent of the  idea of the invalidity of all metaphysical questions]It was

thought to provide the standards to regulate human behavior. It has shaped,

molded and formed all modern attitudes more pervasively than any religion. The

elite of society were people with no apparent religious belief. It was thought

that there was no question that science couldn't solve. Any religious belief in

its path was obliterated. [It is interesting to note the year Calculus was

discovered 1666,and the year relativity was discovered on the Jewish calender

was 5,666.And the Book of revelation considers 666 to be the number of the

Beast[i.e., noga]and the Lekutai Moharan considers scientists to be the Head of

the Snakei.e., Kilpat Noga]So clearly Science needs to be connected to fear of

God or it falls into evil.]

Since the

1700's the number of scientists doubled every 15 years. Since the advent of the

cold war and the threat of nuclear or chemical holocausts, the fervor for

science has cooled off. Now it is pursued mainly for the purpose of making a

living. However the effects of its dominance are still here. However, the

religion of “science and progress” has been debunked. So people go back to

different religions for the answers those religions just don't have. However I

hope i have shown in this book a path by which it is possible to combine

religion and science into a cohesive  organic whole being cable of progress

that each one individually wasn't able to do.

The

existence of the Metaphysical realm is now an indisputable fact, if from the

evidence of people like Rabbi israel Abuchatzaira or Benny Hinn, the Christian

evangelists or the miracle workers of India.

Now to

dispute the existence and validity of miracles is to maintain a faith that

contradicts documented facts that have been and continue to be validated every

day.

I believe

that the place where science and faith touch is the world of math, the lowest

sepherah

of the spiritual world and the top sepherah of the physical world. And to show

how there really is no contradiction between faith and science. But each must

remember its proper place, and in what it is qualified to judge, and in what it

is not (Theoretically physics and the Torah predict their own limits).

Also I

hope I have shown the meaning of the Zohar that says “God loves the Divine

trait (sepherah) of Royalty (Mathematics) so much, that he put the workings of

His whole house into her hands, so that all the higher and lower worlds operate

under her principles.”

My final

conclusion is that ONE NEEDS FAITH AND REASON, malchus and chachmah.

These two

sephirot need to revolve around each other and thus produce the energy needed

to make a better world.
