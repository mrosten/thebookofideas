Section I - Philosophy and Faith

Chapter 1 – God, the Song of

God

Rabbi Eliyahu

The Gaon from Vilna said “there are two things about God that one

always has to keep in mind; one is that he is infinitely great and beyond our

understanding; the other that he is infinitely close to us.” Because of this,

no matter how close we try to get to God, there are always many more ways to

go. How much closer to infinity is a hundred than one? Not much. So even if we

spend our lives getting closer to God from the aspect of his infinite distance,

we are still far. But if we spend our lives getting close to him from the

aspect of his infinite closeness, then we also can't make him much closer

[1]

. Since

God is both infinitely close and far at once (and this is impossible to

comprehend) thus the only place one can find God is really in one's heart where

one feels God.

·

There is

a force in the world called God.  All forces are included in Him, but He is

really a separate force from the forces of nature. There are three aspects of

God:

●

The spiritual level immediately above every individual level.

●

The spiritual level that is inward.

●

God as he really is--infinitely above and beyond everything.

When He

acts, his mark is unmistakable like in the splitting of the Red Sea, or with

the miracles associated with saints. But there is no way of predicting when or

where He will act. He has a tendency to act in cases of prayer or trust but

that isn't a rule it is just a tendency. He objects very strongly to being

demanded to do anything. This is the reason the redemption didn't come during

the second Temple period.

Even

though He tends to act on behalf of those that trust in Him, that trust has to

be strong enough to balance out the sins of the one trusting. One can never

tell who is righteous, since a righteous person might be doing less than he

could and therefore he is considered wicked; while a wicked person may be doing

everything he can and therefore be considered righteous. Since force tends to

act only for those who it

considers

to be righteous it can easily act

for those that we consider to be very wicked people.

Spinoza's Proof of God - mathematical

The core

of Spinoza's proof of God is that God includes existence in his essence and

existence needs no cause because its essence is to exist (but God also has

infinite attributes besides existence.) At any rate existence needs to exist

only after it has some probability to exist which comes from the world of

akudim

which gives the wave function of the probability for the existence of the

spiritual and physical universe. That probability function in itself has a

cause, which has a cause etc., ad infinitum. This sequence of causes itself

needs a cause etc., ad infinitum - vertically - until we get to God vertically

and horizontally (ie. set of causes of the physical universe, set of causes of

the spiritual universe, set of causes of the spiritual spiritual universe,

etc.)  And this is the idea of God's infinite essences which are one with

existence and the infinite series of causes, and the cause of the infinite

series of causes, and the cause of the cause of the infinite series of causes

etc. And then we are only dealing with the first type of infinity like the

numbers between zero and one, or for whatever interval the universe was made

in, but then we have to deal with the infinite types of infinite series of

causes of the spiritual universes.

Spinoza,

by his proof of the existence of God, wanted to avoid the problems involved

with defining God as being the first cause (for who says there has to be a

limit to the number of causes) He didn't want God to be the first cause at all

rather existence itself (or the essence of existence). The way he avoids the

opposite conclusion is by the way he defines a true idea in the treatise on

human understanding. According to that work lack of existence isn't a true idea

or a true essence at all. However Hegel considers BEING to contain its opposite

nothingness and by the contradiction that each concept contains its opposite

comes to the more refined idea of Being i.e., Becoming which is what God meant

when Moses asked his name and he said “I will be that which I will be” for the

name Ehyeh means “I will be” and is the name of the highest

sepherah

in

each world

crown

. This means that the real idea of Being is possible to

come to only after an infinite progression of dialectic. This is the reason God

is so hard to touch, since it really isn't accurate to say that he is since

that is only the first approximation of describing Him. He is like dx which is

not nothing but is infinitely small and thus contains two opposites, being and

non-being. The end of Hegel's infinite progression is what I mean above by

Existence.

Spinoza'a

proof is like the Henkin sentence which by asserting its own provability

becomes provable. It has the ability to reflect on itself and thus logically

proves the existence of God on the real level, not just in logic. It reaches

out of itself like the strange loops that logic is filled with. Since Spinoza's

system is consistent it has to reach out so to speak into another plane as all

formal systems do -- just as number theory, in order to be consistent, has to

postulate super numbers.

Spinoza's

proof of God is based on the basic idea that everything that exists either is

self-causing or it is not. That which is, is defined as God. Now even though

there is a possibility to say everything came from a quantum fluctuation, still

if in fact that and the formulas involved with its creation came into being

with no cause, that would be Spinoza's “Substance” or God. Only with the

entirety of the Seven axioms do we get to God being one and infinite and

indivisible. So the faith of the Torah is possible to prove but only if you

have faith in the seven axioms of Spinoza, which correspond to the seven lower

sephirot

of

Royalty

.

Spinoza's Seven Axioms:

●

Everything

which exists, exists either in itself or in something else.

●

That

which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through

itself.

●

From

a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows and, on the other hand, if

no definite cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect can follow.

●

The

knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the knowledge of a cause.

●

Things

which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the one by means of the

other the conception of one does not involve the conception of the other.

●

A

true idea must correspond with its ideate or object.

●

If

a thing can be conceived as non-existing, its essence does not involve

existence

Spinoza Further Detail

As to B.

Russell's and Kants' criticism of Spinoza's proof of God, where they

differentiate between the existence of a thing and the idea of a thing, I must

mention that Spinoza deals with the true idea or the essence which isn't the

same as the idea. This however doesn't disprove Kant's major thesis. You need

Hegel for that.

Russell

didn't accept the concept of a strange loop and tried to disprove it by a

hierarchical method, but his principle of a self-consistent formal system

without loops has been disproven. Kant and Russell couldn't accept the fact

that a self-consistent formal system can be forced out of itself into a higher

or lower level of existence. Thus, they couldn't accept Spinoza's proof.

Spinoza does postulate cause and effect, so assuming this, would Kant say the

mind causes itself? If so then it would be God by Spinoza definition, and this

is apparently not the case anyway!

·

Idea - God is infinitely

distant behind many screens

To use

the things scientists cannot explain to prove the existence of God is not the

right approach, for what will be done when science gets around to explaining

these things (as has happened many times before)?

The only

real proofs I have seen are Spinoza’s and Descartes’. But it seems that God has

removed His light from the

Empty Space

and the closer we come to proving

Him the further He recedes. So we see that after God's existence is proved

logically, Kant comes around and attacks the ability of logic to prove

anything. And as we reveal His presence in the

empty space

that He has

created the further into the background he recedes. He hides himself in an

infinite series of hidin

g

s, i.e.

f

irst he hides and

then he hides that hiding, so that you do not know that he is hidden, then he

hides that hiding, so that you don't know that he is hiding

that

he is hiding the hiding etc.

This hiding refers to the mental universe of logic and also to the

physical world where God is sometimes revealed by miracles. Yet He still hides

Himself further after the miraculous action. The only

p

lace one can really find God is in

one's

heart, for God reveals himself inside the

hiding place

.

Only by faith can one jump over the doubts and into knowledge.

Regarding

faith, mathematics itself is founded on faith.

Von

Neumann

and Gödel proved the lack of a logical foundation for mathematics -

disproving the basic thesis of Russell and Whitehead’s

Principia Mathematica

.

Whitehead

held that

a priori

knowledge is possible, and the Principia Mathematica

represents that belief.

Von

Neumann, however, disproved the premise that all math can

be based on logic.

In the

Lekutai Moharan, Rabbi Nachman hints at the Big Bang Theory. He equates the

empty

space

with the

lack of belief

and says also that the more one knows

God the more one realizes that they do not know. That adds up to the idea that

the spiritual empty space is expanding. This would imply the same reality in

the physical realm (i.e., the big bang).

[2]

·

Idea - Flux of Secular/Religious Litvak/

Chasid

T

he

idea that nothing exists besides

God is on the level of, “He surrounds all

worlds''

, i.e., the

circular sephirot

. But on the level of the

straight sephirot

, in

which God fills all worlds, His life energy is divided among the different

levels that exist in the order of creation. That is, even though his infinite

light is everywhere and nothing exists besides It, It is not manifest in the

individual creations. The light that is manifest in individual creations is

divided by level. So there are the sparks of holiness in everything, which keep

those things existing on a manifest level. Then, there is the life force and

particular holiness inside

ideas

and

spirit, which keep those things existing

, and gives

to

them their individual character.

When one

concentrates on the idea of

their

existing,

nothing exists besides God, that is when the idea has the

most power. Just as matter cannot curve space unless it is in a concentrated

area, in the same way, this thought cannot draw the light of God unless one

really works at it.

[3]

Chapter 2 – The Song of Faith

·

Faith is

a

force

that

encompasses various forms. In scientists, it

takes a hold of them, causing them to seem to understand the world; and for

mystics -- the understanding of God. Devout people are guided by a different

Divine trait than non-devout. So, for example, non-devout people, by trusting

in God might not get their needs fulfilled unless they actually do something

physical for it;

whereas

for devout people,

they might have all their needs fulfilled through only faith. It might actually

be the opposite of the Divine will for them to do something about it!

According

to the Jewish viewpoint, most spiritual systems represent a valid frame of

reference in the local sense, as long

as

they fulfill

certain criteria. For Jews then, it must not deny the commandments of the

Bible, and for non-Jews, the validity of the 7

-

Noahide

l

aws must be maintained.

This idea

is reflected in a certain book of a Jewish mystic who lived during the Middle

Ages. He stated that it is forbidden for a Jew or Christian to convert to the

other's

faith since “he just mixes up the flow.” One may learn

from the other’s but not convert.

[4]

I believe, however, that all faiths hold mistakes that should be ultimately

corrected.

·

Today, it

is actually possible to test the validity of many statements of the Sages, for

they make empirically verifiable claims, i.e., certain actions causally

precedes certain results. With today’s methods of statistical analysis, it

would be a simple matter to conduct research on such issues.

·

I believe

that religion actually has little effect on

one's

character –

and that is even if the power of

one's

faith

is real and sincere. The Bible is only a tool for those who want to improve. It

is a guide, or map, for ones improvement in many regards, but it is not a bus

to take you there.

The

characters of good and evil are real, and religion has no effect on them. In

fact, while giving those who want to be good a way to do so, it also gives

those who want to simply make money, also a way to do so. And those that are

evil in other ways will find a way to be aided by the religion.

[5]

The

first authorities

[6]

have said that one needs to combine faith and reason. The Lekutai Moharan (Volume

1, Chapter 1) also echoes this when it says that you need faith and wisdom.

According to the

Pardes

, wisdom cannot refer to the Torah

because the Torah is actually Binah in the clothing of

Glory. This may be visualized as follows:

o

ne

needs two

sephirot

revolving around each other to create radiation and

to

affect

character.

·

One can't

help but notice that religions (

T

orah,

B

uddhism, the

S

utras,

C

hristianity,

I

slam)

generally deal a lot with how to escape from suffering and come to happiness

(in this world and the next). This can be understood if you visualize the

religions as occupying the 7 lower

sephirot

, on the

y

⎯

axis. But

once you get up above religion into the 3 higher sephirot, the air has cleared,

so to speak, and we are closer to the light coming in from the upper–vertical

direction. Since good and evil are represented by the x–axis, even though we

may be lying above religion, we are neither good nor evil. The battle is not

between good and evil but rather between truth and mistake.

Perhaps

this explains the opinion of the Rambam that ‘the suffering of Job came because

he did not learn science and philosophy.’ Although he was righteous, he didn't

seek knowledge. Religion is on the level of the 7 lower sephirot which when one

gets involved in automatically causes him suffering. Usually he seeks for

answers in the religion, i.e., via a rabbi or a clergyman within the religion,

but from a higher perspective all knowledge is one.

·

Since

every person's soul is different, the laws of religion can never fit perfectly

with him. Accordingly, by nature, the results of one following the laws of any

religion, if applied with rigor, will then follow patterns of chaos – according

to each individual. If however the laws are applied in a more loose fitting

way, the affects on the person, following patterns of probability, will average

out—like the

binomial distribution

.

[7]

·

There is a basic distinction between the humanistic view and the

religious: namely, the humanistic view places great value on the concept of

freedom whereas the religious view does not consider it at all. The reason for

this may be reflected in that the source of the religious point of view is the

world–of–correction

,

tikun–brudim,

and the source of the humanistic point of view is the

world of

world–points

,

nekudim

. The ultimate correct way is to

have them included in the other.

[8]

·

The main problem

with the worldview of religious fanatics is the vigor with which they insist

just how right they are. If one of their tenets is proved to be a mistake, say

through science, it is science then that has to be rejected. This can not be

held consistently. Those who believe have to have a high level of cognitive

dissonance

going on. Rabbi Nachman says that only faith combined with

knowledge is sturdy, and can not fall.

·

Every

religion has two aspects to it. The first aspect is the faith or individual

commitment and the search for God. This can be seen as being on the right of

the y-axis. The other aspect is that of organization (which is on the left of

the y-axis). Those who occupy the latter area are left brain organizers, and

not right-brain creative thinkers.

Organized

religion

reflects the idea of neurons being connected in a

particular way and solidified—in a way that prohibits freethinking.

Paradoxically that is how Liberalism, Conservatism, Democracy,  Communism etc.,

have all become

religions

.

I

believe, though, that if one learns enough and absorbs the learning into their

deep mind and soul, the force can reach critical mass and be able to break

through and produce new ideas. But most people reside on the subcritical level

and thus are merely on the “religious” level — spewing out what they have heard

(as Lucas wrote in 1961).

·

There

exists one

principle

to

morality and of reaching God and this is

individual

prayer

. Each religion, when it affects those who are searching for God, is

inevitably good — for the person would usually find their way to prayer. The

effect of religion, however, on those not searching for God but for money or

power is bad, because they try to impose their will on others and thus

interfere with the harmonies.

·

There is

a special method of studying that is advocated by Rabbi Nachman. The method

involves reading every page forwards and backwards. To learn in this way takes

tremendous faith and one sees the results only after many years.

·

One can

never really change one

’

s

religion

. Religion is

the

accumulation

of stories, songs and

religious general

consciousness

that one gains

as a child. If one “changes

” his

religion

all he is doing in fact is silencing himself — and say the

person goes into politics he might bring into the new group ideas left over

from his religious mindset — ideas that don’t belong there — ideas such as the

necessity of his way of life upon

all

(or death).

The

Catholics were very clever when they decided to incorporate various elements in

the religions that they conquered instead of banishing them. The Rabbi’s today

also, should

not

dismiss

anything of the culture of those that come to

them, unless he is keenly aware of what is involved (and what are the negative,

and acceptable elements in it).

The

Rambam explains why the Torah required sacrifices. And also regarding how some

of the philosophical tradition came to be incorporated in Judaism by the Sages

and the Rambam was also through this means. And today, the tendency of the

rabbis to take out of the Torah (through ignorance) the things that generations

ago were acceptable, only leads to the destruction of Torah life.

It is

obvious to me the grand departure from the ancient Torah way of life by the

Jews was the result of the rabbis not in being able to evaluate what really was

acceptable in tradition, and what (of what was new) was compatible.

Chapter 3 – The Song of

Philosophy

[MR1]

[MR2]

·

The

ultimate purpose in the creation of the world is the revelation of the oneness

of God. One central method of its accomplishment is by the universal trait of

reciprocity, i.e., the idea behind “what one gives is what one receives.”

By the

active “rewarding” of truth and goodness, and the “punishment” of evil, the

oneness of God is revealed. This happens in every society, in every level of

existence. This process can also be seen as the sifting out of the bad and

bringing up the good to be included in the oneness of God.

This

principle results in infinite chaos depending on any slight variation in

events. How the chaos here results in the oneness there is not known in

detail—an element of it may be what the sages have said: that the good suffer

in this world as punishment for their sin's which they have committed in this

life time or in previous life times so that when they get to the next world

they can receive the undiluted light of God with their loved ones, and the end

result of good being rewarded does not happen until the next world where the

oneness of God is revealed.

·

Because of the compassion of God, He created the world. For he

wanted to reveal His compassion, and there was no creation on whom would He

have to show his compassion. Therefore he made everything from the top of Emanation

to the center of the earth for this purpose,” — Lekutai Moharan

The idea

of the creation of man is for the expression of the goodness of God. For there

was a basic lack in the Divine traits before the world was created — the lack

of the revelation. This may tie in with Hegel’s idea that each trait implies

its opposite.

Another

way of understanding the “lack” in each trait in itself is that as long as it

is not being, it is lacking the

quality

of being used.

[9]

This understanding

leads one to assume that the Divine traits  creations, but essential aspects of

God. For example, to correct the two deficits of

goodness

and

wisdom

there was created the circular sephirot and the straight sephirot.

·

God

created free-will so man could

choose

God, this by choosing good from

evil, and thus have a connection with God based on ones’ own deeds and words

and thoughts and desire, and not based on a free handout. To receive via a free

handout is from the level of

royalty

, whose nature is that it must

receive. This is what the problem was in the very beginning.

But now

man has united Royalty with the higher trait represented by giving through

choosing God and his reward of the light come through his own merits.

[10]

·

From the

idea that God fills all worlds and surrounds all worlds the idea becomes

apparent that one must unite the sparks of holiness in everything with the

infinite presence of God Himself by choosing God in everything he does, says,

thinks, or desires, and thus uniting himself and all creation with God. When

one is united with God then he too can create Godliness. This is indeed the 1

st

commandment in the Torah — to be fruitful and multiply, i.e., in children and

ideas, and music.

•

Pleasure

is on the level of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and therefore not

good or bad in itself but dependent on what one uses it for. If one brings up

the sparks of holiness in that pleasure into holiness, he himself goes up and

the evil falls. Just saying a blessing has nothing to do with this. It depends

a lot on how he raises the children. If it's food it depends on what one does

with the energy. Pleasure for the sake of pleasure remains on the original

level and it falls into evil and becomes evil itself. Pleasure however for the

sake of God and done with attachment to God is like a sacrifice, and is on a

very holy level.

•

Allowing free thought is

important for ideas need room to flow, and when restricted like in a

constricted vessel, they cannot. Similarly, logic, in its purest form, also

limits free thought. Revelation also limits free thought--there are things

beyond the comprehension of the mind that only revelation can reveal.

So,

reason

and

revelation

are the two outer vessels that contain free thought; they

correspond to

Chaya

and

Yechida

. Reason and revelation (i.e., the

heart) should be able to work together but when there is a disagreement, then

obviously one of them is wrong. Reason then reigns usually tends to win out,

and the intuition or revelation is left in the spiritual universe. The

dichotomy of universities and religion (reason and revelation) is the dichotomy

between

chaos

and

correction

, and the goal is to bring the light

of chaos into the vessels of correction. Rabbi Nachman and the Rambam disagreed

whether logic is subjected to revelation or visa versa, but in fact there is no

disagreement. Each has its own area where it is qualified to judge.

·

The

spirit can only reveal things that are of the spirit. There is nothing but God,

so He permeates and is unified with the physical and spiritual universe so

God's presence in the physical universe is subject to logical proof which is

what Spinoza does. But he can't go beyond that into the spiritual realm which

works with mathematical principles but isn't subject to proof. That is the

result of the original condensing in which God removed the revelation and proof

of his presence from the empty space, and only as we progress through time does

God reveal his presence and proof of his Presence one level at a time — as

Rabbi Nachman comments on the empty space and relates levels of revelation to

the outer makifim (fields) in which one level at a time enters humanity. So at

least Spinoza got the first step.

·

“It takes

many years of sifting through false teachers to find a wise one. Don't be so

fast to give up the wise teachers of history for they have been sifted from

millions of false ones and their teachings have stood the test of the ages.” (Greenfield).

The Bible the Sutras, the Talmud, Jesus, and Socrates may seem to contradict

but in fact each sees a different aspect of and points to the same truth. Each

were digging up the building blocks of the final structure. (Not to say that

the structure is ever finished) Some people are content to poke around the

stones, and others to try to knock down someone else's stone I think it is

wiser to assemble them into one great building and then to ride the elevator to

the top to see further.

·

Nietzsche

was a spark of Jeremiah the prophet whose root is in pure Judgment. Since he

wasn't Jewish he lacked the one defining characteristic of the Jewish soul –

integration, i.e., combining and integrating judgment with kindness.

This is

how Einstein was able to combine electro-magnetism with kinematics and also was

the root of his idea of combining all the four forces into one. Other examples

of this are the Rambam combining revelation and reason, Spinoza combining

philosophy and mathematics.

·

God is

both secular and religious. On the level of the 3 highest

sephirot

God is secular, and on the level of the lower 7, He is

religious. The constant flux between these two poles creates the wave pattern

that is so characteristic of Western civilization. The Greeks and Romans were

quite religious yet their thinkers were secular. The Jewish world also is

characterized by the interplay between the different poles that vary with time,

e.g.,

chasidus

and the Gra, Kabbalah and legalism, Sepharadi and

Ashkenazi, etc.

•

On The Nature of God

and Existence

God

contains the set of all things, the existing and the non-existing. But that is

only on one plane of reality. You have to go up to the next level and there God

also is and includes the set of all

ideas

existing and non-existing, and

so on vertically.

Existence

itself is only one characteristic of God. The hidden face where he makes

himself

non-existent

is a result of our own hiding ourselves from him by not

talking and communicating with him.

•

Idea - On the Oneness

of God

The idea

of the Oneness of God is that the

c

reator of

everything is one and not many.

The idea

doesn't deny that there are many things and forces in the world

, b

ut the idea of God's oneness is that the One God created

everything and controls everything.

The idea

of the Torah that

:

“

There is nothing besides Him [God]” is that only God

has true existence and everything else derives its existence from him

constantly.

Gods

being one has to mean one substance, not one quality or quantity because if He

is one quality and one quantity then he is by definition already two things.

When the Torah says God is one, it doesn't mean continuous since then God would

be divisible. If one means indivisible -- it says that nothing exists besides

God since everything is included in or part of his Godliness -- then nothing

can have quality or quantity. If it means the essence of God is one, and the

essence of everything is God, then to be good or evil is the exact same thing!

Rather it

is like I said above -- the intention of the Torah is that there is a Creator

and that creator is one, the one cause of existence. These arguments I got from

Aristotle (in his Physics) who used them to refute the idea that all being is

one.

Idea - Coming to

Absolute Knowledge:

Rabbi

Nachman held that absolute knowledge is possible only by revelation

. And

if one lacks that, then he can depend on faith.

H

e held that there is some point that the human mind can't

cross in order to come to absolute knowledge without faith. Rabbi Nachman

believed

that one can come to faith by prayer.

It seems

that in this, Kant and Rabbi Nachman agreed -- that by pure reason, a-priori

knowledge is not possible. This seems to be vindicated by Quantum Mechanics

for, as in quantum mechanics, the reality we perceive is affected by our

perception of it.

Reason

then, would be needed for the clarification of revelation. It is clear that

reason has a higher place than faith in Rabbi

Nachman's

schema, as the first chapter of the

Likutei

Moharan makes clear. But to come to make that final step to God, even with

reason, is impossible to achieve except through  faith.

However,

Hegel pointed out that Kant was wrong -- because he treats ideas as mental

entities rather than logical entities within the set of

logic

space

. But

even if we would accept what Kant had to say, we could still show the existence

of God on whatever level we are willing to concede exists. For we admit that

the laws of logic work in our minds, he just asks how do we know they work in

the outside world -- so he is willing to concede the existence of an outside

world.

Now,

existence must exist and

nothingness

cannot exist, because if

nothingness would exist, then it is not

nothing

- i.e., you cannot say

about nothing the word “is”, because if it is

something

then it is not

nothing

.

Now, if

existence caused itself, when did it cause itself? Either before it existed or

after. If before, then it couldn't have caused itself, if after - then it

already existed, and needed nothing to cause it to exist. So, it must have been

caused by a Creator who needed no cause to exist but exists in and of Himself.

Since the

existence of our own logic is created by some outside cause and that cause is

not in our own minds, so the basic pattern of cause and effect hasn't been

created by our own minds but comes from an outside cause.

So, cause

and effect are not a product of our own minds. The limitation to one first

cause is because if there would be an infinite number of causes then you could

never get to cause anything to exist now for it would have had to travel in its

causes an infinite number of times -- which is impossible, for it would never

get to the “now” which has a discrete place in time. Thus, there is a limit to

the number of causes.

You can't

object with Zeno's paradox that this same logic would disprove motion since

causes are discrete things and you need in fact one discreet cause to cause

another: while measuring the distance is something we impose on the moving

ball.

When you

get to the first cause you come to God. Thus, there is a creator and he is one.

Now, since time and space may curve in on themselves, we could say that the

number of causes is finite but keeps going around in a circle. But that still

is not an objection since we are still thinking in a time loop going around in

a larger time space.  The point is we still are reduced to cause and effect

which has to have a limit.

Hegel

limits the number of causes in a different way. From two opposite concepts he

goes to a more central concept, and so on, until he gets to God by encircling

Him and narrowing down the range of the circle by his system of dialectics.

That is

actually different than my way of a long line of causes and finding God at the

end. Hegel uses dialectics like a

Mobius Strip

which starts at one side

and ends up on the other side. Thus, he limits the number of causes by

encircling the first cause. Hegel considered the array of logical

contradictions in logic to be like the Mobius Strip that reduce two sides to

one and eventually narrows down all truth to one point. The idea of my proof is

different for I am saying that Kant admitted that the Spinozian proof of God

did prove Him, but only in the world of the mind and logic. What about Reality?

I showed that if we admit to a world of reality besides the mind then we have

to admit that at least one law works there -- that of cause and effect. And once

we get to that we have proved God in the world of reality also.

At any

rate, I am using the idea of the Strange Loop in my proof having one level

refer to another level and so on till we get to God by a progression from the

physical universe to the spiritual one, until we get to infinite spirituality,

which again reconnects to the physical universe. This explains my idea of Free

Will in the section on Happiness -- which I would call the strange Spiral.

Thus, just like if we postulate that the system of natural numbers is complete,

we have to assume existence of super numbers. So, if logic is complete, we have

to assume the existence of a super logic. This supper logic, if we assume it is

complete, we have to assume the existence of a super logic etc.

·

To Hegel,

by dialect, one can come to knowledge, by an infinite progression of dialect

until one comes to the Absolute. [

Dialect

is the

process by which every logical reality is shown to be implicitly

self-contradictory and thus imply the need for a new, wider category that

contains them and resolves them until one comes to the Absolute Idea. So, if we

take the limit as the dialect approaches infinity, we get to God.

Aristotle's

proof of God is that even if we would

believe

it possible

for there to be an infinite progression of causes so you could never get to the

first cause, still, by that same reasoning nothing could move for it would need

to go back to an infinite number of causes to finally get to move. [This seems

to me to be like

Zeno's

paradox]. Thus, there

has to be a Prime Mover. But if it were moving then it also would need a mover.

Thus, the prime mover must move things without being moved itself. That is, by

causing motion by attraction rather than by propulsion. Attractive causes

operate on intelligences, so it is an intelligence that keeps a star in motion.

So, the intelligence causes the star to move by means of its moving toward the

prime mover. Now to move and not be moved, that Prime Mover must not be matter.

Now, all matter have to have form but not all form needs to have matter. Thus,

the prime mover is form without matter. If we substitute existence instead of

motion, we get a more modern proof that works along Hegel’s lines of God being

the Prime Idea that combines the opposites of Being and non-Being, i.e.,

Becoming — which answers the infinitesimal problem (for Becoming can only be on

an infinitesimal level, one dx at a time.)

·

This is

Spinoza's proof that God is one. Here Spinoza limits the Creator of each

universe, physical, spiritual, spiritual of spiritual etc., [horizontally], and

the first cause [vertically] to One, by the fact that only one substance can be

conceived with infinite attributes. That is, there is only one First Cause of

all the sets. The immediate level of spirituality above every level is referred

to as God in a borrowed way, since it is the manifestation of God, but not

really God, who is outside the set of all causes, but also the set of all

causes and the set of all the sets of all causes, etc...

PROP. XIV.

Besides God no substance can be

granted or conceived.

Proof. --

As God is a being

absolutely infinite, of whom no essence that must exist can be denied [ God is

a being absolutely infinite--that is, a substance consisting in infinite

attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.] [

An

attribute is that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of

substance.]

and he necessarily exists (by Prop. xi.) [ God, or substance,

consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite

essentiality, necessarily exists.] if any substance besides God were granted it

would have to be explained by some attribute of God, and thus two substances

with the same attribute would exist, which (by Prop. v.) [There cannot exist in

the universe two or more substances having the same nature or attribute.] is

absurd therefore, besides God no substance can be granted, or consequently, be

conceived. If it could be conceived, it would necessarily have to be conceived

as existent, but this (by the first part of this proof) is absurd. Therefore,

besides God no substance can be granted or conceived. Q.E.D.

Corollary I

.--Clearly, therefore: 1.

God is one, that is only one substance can be granted in the universe, and that

substance is absolutely infinite.

Corollary II

.--It follows: 2. That

extension and thought are either attributes of God or (by Ax. i.) accidents

(affections) of the attributes of God.

PROP. XV

. Whatsoever is, is in

God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.

Proof. --

Besides God, no substance

is granted or can be conceived (by Prop. xiv.)[By God, I mean a being

absolutely infinite--that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of

which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.], that is (by Def.

iii.) nothing which is in itself and is conceived through itself. But modes (by

Def. v.) [Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the one by

means of the other the conception of one does not involve the conception of the

other.] can neither be, nor be conceived without substance wherefore they can

only be in the divine nature and can only through it be conceived. But

substances and modes form the sum total of existence (by Ax. i.), therefore,

without God nothing can be, or be conceived. Q.E.D.

Rabbi

Issac Luria says that the generations from Adam to Noah were evil and so were

reborn at the time of the flood to receive their punishment, in this world.

Similarly, the generations before the dispersion and the tower of Babylon.

Similarly, the generations before the destruction of the 1

st

Temple.

And similarly, the generations before the Holocaust.

The

purpose of the creation of the world is the revelation of the oneness of God.

This is

accomplished

by the trait of what one gives

is what one gets. By the rewarding of good and truth and punishment of evil is

revealed the oneness of God. This happens on every level, in every society, in

every level of existence. This is the process of sifting out of the bad, and

the bringing up of the good, in order to be included in the oneness of God.

The idea

of the creation of man is for someone for God to do good to. There was a basic

lack in the divine traits before the world was created. This lack was not in

the higher traits themselves but in the Royalty (the lowest) of the Infinite

one, i.e., in the revelation of the traits.

So, God

had to create man in order to have someone to do good to: and the highest good

is God himself. But, how can man have any connection with God himself!? So, God

created Free Will, so that man could choose God —this by choosing good from

evil — and thus have a connection with God — based on his own deeds and words,

thoughts and desires — not based on a free hand-out. This is in itself on the

level of Royalty, which needs to receive, and that was the problem in the 1

st

place. But now, man has united Royalty with the higher trait of giving, by

choosing God, and not needing a free-handout to receive his reward of the light

of God based upon his merits.

This is

based on the Ramchal, together with the beginning of the Eitz Chayim, and the

Lekutei Moharan — but with a bit of integration.

The idea

is: God fills all worlds and surrounds all worlds — so one must unite the

sparks of holiness in everything with the infinite presence of God himself by

choosing God in everything he does, says, or thinks, or desires — and thus

uniting himself and all creation with God. When one is united with God than he

too can create Godliness, and this is the 1

st

commandment in the

Torah of being fruitful and to multiply, and children and ideas, and music.

·

The

contradiction between absolute knowledge and free-will is that God knows what

one will cho

ose

not just from the future but from now (ie. not just

because He knows the future). This contradiction is the root of Quantum

Mechanics.

·

Ideas are

wave functions that travel at the speed of light and have all the

characteristics of a quantum wave. That's why it's important not to think about

your enemies badly so that your

s

and theirs wave function

doesn't mutually interfere and just darkness is left. Don't send your waves in

that direction at all, for their waves can't bother yours at all unless you do.

·

One can

combine two points of view into one by considering the combination of each

point in the first and the second and drawing a line through each of them into

the new space of the name 45. This is in the straight sephirot and the same can

be done in the circular sephirot.

·

The

uncertainty principle applies to all aspects of life and is the root of free

will. For instance the conflict between freedom of thought (thinking for

yourself) and listening to the wise. We find in the Torah itself this conflict,

for even though we are supposed to listen to the Sanhedrin, still there is a

whole section of the Torah which describes the types of sacrifice which must be

brought when the Sanhedrin makes a mistake. And the Sages say that if one knew

they were wrong, yet still acted on their opinion, he is responsible for his

own actions.

·

Ideas

rotating around a common axis will give off its rest energy and energy of

motion in the form of idea waves. That is the power

of t

he works of philosophy of Spinoza who takes a few basic

axioms and revolves them around each other until a whole work evolves out of it

-

which represents the energy of motion - for after

Spinoza was done, the idea

’s

implications of

the axioms were fixed in idea space. However, the rest energy continues to

affect

a larger circumference of people.

·

The book

Madregat HaAdam created a vast mass movement but disappeared in one generatio

n. This was

because it was built on one idea alone (absolute trust in

God) which is a great idea but doesn't give off much energy since it rotates on

its own axis, not around another major idea.

That is

the same problem with Rav Shik's books based only on the principle that nothing

exists besides God which is also good but again nothing comes of it because it

is only one axiom. (Most Christian books I've seen have the same problem except

for Thomas Aquines, who basically does the same thing as Spinoza.)

Rabbi

Nachman creates in every individual chapter a revolving system, and all the

systems revolve around a common set of basic axioms. I believe that the Bible

and Jesus represent one revolving system (on one axis God, and the basic 13

axioms of faith) and that is the reason for their power

).

God

created the world based on two principles, chaos and order, which stem from the

Divine names, 63 and 45. The purpose of creation is to integrate them and bring

them up to the name 72.

·

An old philosophy paper I wrote as a

teenager:

A.

“To examine an object pedantically is not to

think. It is an examination by a specific formula which has no bearing on the

idea itself. It is examination from a different viewpoint than that of the

idea's maker and cannot do (accomplish) anything. It is insensitivity to the

idea. It is lack of understanding. [For example] to examine myself from an

entirely psychological and rational point of view is not to understand myself.

B.

“Assuming that a

person's

essence is always good and that he can always choose what

course of action he will take, then the closer he gets to his soul, the more

the soul will control his will. And the more control the soul will have over

the will.

C.

Genius is a sign that one is in contact with

his soul.

D.

One can understand the logic of an idea, but

not its essence until he is one with the idea.

E.

The bricks of the universe are beauty, and

its blueprint is God. Beauty is the substance and God is the concept. [The idea

or the form in Plato's terminology]

.

F.

“But true thinkers think with concepts and

ideas with no root either in self or words or in logic. Pure thinking is just a

free interplay of concepts between the mind and the soul with only intuition

used to

choose

the good from the bad. If the ideas truly come from the

soul, then they will eventually fit into the world of logic either by the one

who

thought

it... or the idea will die until

another time to be given birth by another mind. Ideas in this form are truly

logical and not just rational.

G.

Logical thinking results in a creation of

value or of no value depending on the path of the logic taken by the mind. Many

paths may seem logical to the mind with only one resulting in some valid

result. To find that path one needs the help of the soul.

·

Zeno's

proof that there is no motion is that before an object can go any distance it

has to go half that distance. And before it can go that much it has to go a

half of the last amount. Thus, by an infinite progression it is impossible to

move since the object always has to travel an infinitesimal amount — and

infinitesimal amounts can't add up since you need an infinite amount of them to

add up to anything.

It has

seemed to me in general to answer Zeno's paradox to say that space is

quantized

. Just like there is no time below Plank time, there is no

space past a certain point. However, Calculus derives motion by reducing the

distance of the motion down to an infinitely small amount and by this it

derives the true equations of motion.

So

apparently there is a reality to an infinitesimal amount in the real world?

Chapter 4 – Piety

“Piety dies not with men; in their life and in their death it is

immortal.”

-Sophocles

·

The

contradiction of the empty space not having the light of God in it and yet the

fact that there is no place empty of His presence (“for the whole earth is full

of His Glory.” -

Isaiah

chapter 6) is the root of Quantum mechanics and

the wave function becoming a particle as it is observed is parallel to the fact

that God's presence is everywhere until you try to observe it, and then the

laws of the empty space take over which is the root of all non-belief in God.

Thus, we find that trying to get close to God has the effect of destroying a

person's spirituality. In Quantum mechanics we learn, change can only happen

when you aren't looking.

·

Most

people's lives have one focal point or center of mass

(a

nd so it is with nations also). If it is an elliptical

orbit there are two centers. But this is on different planes of spirituality,

i.e., on the basic level God alone should be the center of gravity. But on the

other level how can one serve or know God? So, he has to circle around the

righteous one who contains the light of God in him. So even though God is

everythin

g,

in another way (the level of “He

fills

all worlds”) He is the light inside the righteous one --

thus we find people focusing on Jesus or Rabbi Nachman or Halacha or the land

of Israel etc.

The right way is to concentrate on God alone and follow all

these things as tools to come close to God; but not to concentrate on the

tools.

·

People's

lives are like

sine

or

cosine

functions so

that even as they progress closer to God (the origin) the function really

doesn't change — just the ups and downs get less. This is the reason

everything

turns into its opposite. But this is only if one doesn't

progress towards the origin (God) which dampens the oscillations. (The idea

that everything turns into its opposite [as the Sages said in terms of the poor

becoming

rich and vice versa; “There is a

wheel which is turning in the world.”] only applies on the level of the lower

six sephirot, not the top three, so

Science and Kabbalah tend to help one to

rise out of the rat race

.)

There is

the

sine

function for the day, week, month, year, life. There is in

every person's life one peak. After that they waste the rest of their lives

trying to get it back. Nothing leads to as much unhappiness as the pursuit of

happiness.

True

Enlightenment comes only once in a lifetime. As we see with Jacob that first he

had a great revelation from God and a great promise on his way to Laban. Then

on his way back he had to fight with God [i.e., God revealed himself again to

Jacob, but this time as a man and as an enemy.]

And then he

had years of trouble in Israel. After that he only had years of peace in Egypt.

For this world is only a preparation for the next. Here one must suffer the

love and wrath of God, and

only then

one c

an

become a man.

·

The

commandments aren't an automatic drawing of holiness. They are like functions

that you have to first put in the number 0. You have to draw the holiness by

love and fear of God (as per the

tikkunim

of Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato)

which come only by science and

kabbalah

(known to the sages by

the name, “Work of Creation”

,

and “Divine

Chariot''

, which the Sages of the Talmud call a great and important

thing, in relation to the Talmud which they call a small thing) as the Rambam

states at the beginning of

Mishneh

Torah.

·

The

reason you have to pray alone in a closet or in a forest is that all spiritual

matter and energy are a wave attached to God; until it is observed, at which

point it is a particle. Like Rabbi Nachman said that observing something makes

a “vessel”, i.e., makes something have a specific place and time. It seems in

the Eitz Chayim that this was caused by the original breaking of the vessels in

nekudim

,

i.e., the original symmetry. For before that, there was no

reason to think that the vessels would have fallen just by being looked at. So,

it seems that in their original state they could have stayed connected to God

in their wave particle form even after being looked at. But I'm not sure about

this

,

since the breaking was apparently from

too much light coming at once, which seems like a macrocosmic event along the

lines of classical Physics.

·

On Nov.

19, 1619, Descartes crawled inside a large stove, and spent the day in privacy,

warmth, and darkness, meditating. There he had a vision - that everything, man

nature, the cosmos all work by means of Mathematical principles. That is by

hiding himself he got in contact with his higher root by becoming a wave. That

was right after the period of Rabbi Isaac Luria and Rabbi Joseph Karo, so

Kabbalah and Halacha had been brought to their perfection and the time for

science had come.

·

Although

there is

an

absolute

center of the empty space, each individual

also ha

s,

in a parallel way, the level of the

line of

God's

light in his individual

direction

–

just as space-time manifolds have,

at each point, a double-cone of light-like directions.

·

The two

types of prayer are speaking with God when the light flows horizontally from

the circular sephirot and praying up to God when the light flows from the

straight

sephirot

, vertically. This is why by the graves of the

righteous it is usually easier to pray since the light is vertical, while away

from there one can only talk with God horizontally unless by some merit, he can

draw the vertical light upon himself.

·

The

reason one must pray very hard before he is answered is because the Zohar says

God is hidden and revealed. Which means that there are quantum states of

prayer. So just like in the atom if you put some small amount of energy into

the electron, the atom acts as a whole and hides its inner workings. Only if

you give it a lot of energy will the electron budge individually. Thus, it is

with prayer. Sometimes to get an answer you need to put a lot of time and

effort into your prayers.

·

Many

sages have offered a whole range of solutions to the problems of Yidishkeit

ranging from learning books of ethics and fear of God [

Musar

],

Chassidut

,

Kabbalah

,

Hisbodedut

,

extreme strictness in

Halachah

; some have offered different ways of

combining these things by doing a little of each every day. I believe that all

these things are merely tools. It's like climbing a mountain

:

some people are given one tool, and some are given all the

tools. Some are placed on an easier side of the mountain and some on a tougher

side. Not any one tool will work all the time for all the people or even one

person. Everything depends on the individual alone, his desire to get to the

top, his stamina, his perseverance, his intelligence, and understanding how to

use the tools. And even with all that he can still stick the chisel in the

wrong place! (Marry the wrong person and fall to his spiritual doom -- or

divorcing the wrong person), so one need's just plain help from God.

The proof

that none of the above

doctrines

really work very well except for certain individuals is

the adherents themselves of each doctrine. But the lack of basic human

integrity on the part of the followers of each doctrine wouldn't be a disproof

unless the Torah itself made integrity an fundamental part of saintliness,

–

as mentioned in the writings of Rabbi Sar Shalom Sharabi,

the

Chafetz

Chayim

, and the first authorities (I admit however

that this logic is limited for only 1960's people cared about finding the right

philosophy of life while most people just search a bit to find something which

makes them content and then cease to think and get on with what they consider

the more important business of money and sex and power). So even a correct

principle will have only a limited effect.

The real

proof against all the doctrines is the fanatical adherents who according to

their principles should have found some degree of perfection! Instead, we find

people divided along the old lines of character traits which don't differ at

all from religion to religion. The only effect of the religion seems to be on

the people as a whole - to bring them to a slightly higher (or lower or just

different) level than before and on the few individuals who use the tools

rightly. What matters is fear of God, and each religion simply provides one way

of expressing it if it already is inside of one. Even if each religion is wrong

in the eyes of the other that doesn't matter as it says in the verse “in every

place they are sacrificing to My Name

–

(Yechezkel),

even though they are in fact serving idols, since in their minds that is what

God wants, God accepts their offerings as if they were sacrificing to his name.

As the Sages said along similar lines, “God said to do [the commandments];

however we to them is pleasant for Him.”

·

The soul

will rebel if ignored. The Jewish soul demands the Torah and the commandments.

For this reason, I have had to show how Torah itself gives the freedom

necessary to develop artistically or scientifically.

Baalei Teshuva

didn't make up the desire to be religious. It is the essential core of all

Mankind.

Even

Einstein said that the basic essence of a scientist is the desire to understand

the universe and that is essentially a religious principle.  The families of

those who get the religious “bug” must learn to grin and bear it for many years

and still stick with him/her. In the end they will appreciate it… It is not an

aberration, it is a profound instinct in man, but it can cause a lot of upsets

in the family and friends.

Each side

must learn the importance of sticking with the other for our families are not

accidental. Hey are essential parts of

one’s

soul. Life is

about accepting our family and friends for who they are and not thinking that

we are going to improve anything by going elsewhere — or else life is about

learning this lesson.

Meditation

is the main theme of Rabbi Shneur Zalman however it is mentioned by Rabbi

Nachman as the calling to God from the depths of

one's

heart

without voice or words. The Books of

musar

emphasize it as

“Contemplation of the

Soul” of

the

Chovot

Halevavot

.

The Sages

of the Talmud said the first Chasidim used to wait one hour before and after

every prayer. Then it was asked in the Gemara, “Then for the three prayers

every day it comes out to be nine hours. When did they learn anything? The

Gemara answered, since they were Chasidim [i.e., pious] their learning was

guarded

/

blessed inside of them. To the person that said

“

guarded

”

it was only

guarded. To the person that said blessed, their learning

was

actually increased.” Now it is clear that they weren't

praying or learning but meditating. [Since the main problem in meditation is

the discipline needed, I suggest taking an oath to sit and do it for a certain

amount of time. An oath is a powerful tool because it turns a motivation to do

a good thing into a motivation not to transgress a very serious sin which is

stronger.

The idea of oaths was given by the Torah to help the weak of

spirit

. Incidentally an oath should only be taken day by day, never for

more than that since, “Who knows what tomorrow may bring?”

The

Brit

Menuchah

mentions that Prophecy comes from the

saints of old that afflicted themselves to come to some spiritual levels. Rabbi

Nachman also mentions this in

Likutei

Moharan,

Vol.

1,

C

h. 24, that the crown

prevents the mind from reaching the infinite light, and thus by the hitting on

the mind on the constraint of the crown are made vessels to receive the light.

Fear of

God

is the key to wisdom, but many times the fear of God of the

parents results in the wisdom of the children. Other times depending on its

strength it causes the person that has it to be wise. University professors

will in general have religious parents which resulted in their children being

wise.

Since

Fear of God is such a key factor in wisdom and besides that we have. Rabbi

Nachman's way of learning I would like to suggest a way of learning that would

result in even a stupid person becoming wise:

(a)

Learn books of ethics and fear of God every

day and keep what they say to do.

(b)

Learn the subjects you want to learn every

day by just saying the words of the book in order from the beginning of the

book until the end without skipping or repeats. When you finish the entire

book, only then should you repeat the book again. [Sichot Haran 76] This may

take years, but I think over the course of much time one will see a greater

blessing in his learning than if he had learned in the regularly accepted way.

“Fear of

God increases days”

Stanislav

Kasl of Yale and Ellen Idler of Rutgers, studied 2,812 people in New Haven.

They discovered that outwardly religious people, whether Jewish, Protestant or

Catholic, were less likely to become medically disabled, than those who didn't

attend church or synagogue.

A study

of 454 men and 85 women in Jerusalem showed that secular [non­religious] Jews

had a greater risk of heart disease than Orthodox Jews. Analysts from the

University of Florida found that counties in the USA with the highest number of

religious people have the lowest rates of cancer. Dr. Larson and his colleagues

did a study on 400 men in Georgia, found that people that believed in God and

attended religious services had the lowest readings of blood pressure.

Those

that had one or the other had higher levels. Those with neither had the highest

readings. Dr. Larson and his team also reviewed more than 200 studies on

religious commitment and mental health and found that religious people have

lower rates of depression, alcoholism, suicide, and drug use than non-religious

people. Young people who are religious also do better in school and are less

likely to be sexually active. Married people that are religious reported

greater marital happiness, more satisfaction with their sex lives and lower

rates of divorce.

The

researchers examined specific concrete behavior like attending services, not

just abstract belief. [From the book

Age Erasers for Men

by Doug

Dollemore Rodale Books, Pennsylvania, 1994]. This certainly doesn't seem like

Saint Frances of Assisi who held that you can't live a lifestyle of peace and

own

material

possessions and still be called a Christian at all.

However, I think fear of God has to be entered into with a willingness to do

what is required regardless of the consequences — but the end result in general

is that of peace and happiness. We find Haran burned even though Abraham was

saved because Abraham was willing to be thrown in the furnace regardless of the

consequences. Thus, was saved. Haran was willing to be thrown in only because

he thought he would be saved.

·

Since the

Jewish people do not have the surrounding light of the circular sephirot their

only evil is in community actions [actions that can be ascribed only to the

community at large] like acquiescence to evil that their leaders and rabbis do,

but individually they are righteous. That is why punishment comes upon them

usually as a group as in the Holocaust, but individually their fear of God

brings them blessing physically mentally and financially and in their children.

The Christians on the other hand are collectively righteous as in America while

individually they are usually coarse Goyim. [This is why Christian Evangelists

can do miracles only in large groups where all the collective prayers and faith

join together to draw the soul of Jesus, while individual Jewish saints

generally can do only private miracles.] This is the reason why the Jewish

people can't make a nation at peace even within itself much less with the Arab

world surrounding it since they lack that outer light. This is the intention of

the prophets when they prophesied that the Jewish people would have bad leaders

as a result of their sins, i.e., the prophets saw the outer light would be

taken from them and replaced by

klipot

so that the actions of the Jewish

people as a whole would be evil though individually each person would be

righteous. This is also the intent of the Zohar when it refers to “Rabbis that

are Jewish demons

”

. And this is the intent of the Sages when they blame the

world’s problems on the Jewish leaders and

rabbis

of each

g

eneration. They aren't

engaged in hyperbole but a statement of fact.

The

relation between

mitzvoth

and prayer to physical deeds is parallel to

the relation between logic and revelation which is parallel to the relation

between trusting in God and action. Saints went to one side of the spectrum and

philosophers went to the other. The path of the Rambam was to defer to logic

when there was a difference between Reason and Revelation. It is my opinion

that revelation [the Crown] is the main thing and Reason [Wisdom] is only to

understand and apply revelation to real life situations. Thus, it comes out according

to this that trust in God is the main thing and action is secondary. Thus,

people from the different faiths that chose separation from this world as the

proper path would be going according to this logic, and in fact it seems that

their great devotion to God resulted in their gaining some kind of closeness

with him [

Baba

Sali or Saint Frances of Assisi]. I have heard that Rav

Sonnenfeild from Jerusalem decided as a young man that he would take the first

match offered to him and thus he did depending on God divine providence that

she would be the right one. And in fact, they had a long happy marriage. Yet I

would agree with that only in conjunction with the advice of George Fox of then

taking advice from one's family. This would be in accordance with the principle

of the sephirah of the Crown first [trust], then reason [Wisdom].

·

The

Rambam's writes, “Consequently he who wishes to reach perfection, must first

study Logic, and then the different parts of Mathematics in their right order,

then physics, then Metaphysics (what today we call philosophy) -- [The Guide

I:34]. Then when God sees that your spiritual vessels are ready, He will shine

his light on you [The Guide III:52].

However,

he says in connection with prophecy, that even after proper preparation, there

is no guarantee that He will give you prophecy for the Rambam held that

intuition is like IQ — it is a naturally born power, of which some people have

more and some less — but everyone has to some degree [The Guide II:32 and 38].

He held

the prophets increased this faculty by learning. The Rambam obviously held that

there is a point that what is internalized in the mind becomes part of the

spirit — similar to Hegel. However, I think that by meditation, which

corresponds to the level of the Crown, one can increase his degree of intuition

and awareness of God's will. The fact that the Rambam held the gift of prophecy

to be a naturally-born thing, which God adds to if one merits, explains why the

Jewish sages in the past that don't seem to have meditated, merited to great

spiritual levels.

But it is

also possible that they did meditate, for the unifications of the Ari and Rabbi

Abulafia are clearly in thought (not speech) though some of them can be spoken —

but not many.

The

Rambam wrote in the Guide and Mishna Torah that one needs to learn Torah first

in order to know the laws of conduct — however, he also writes in the beginning

of Mishna Torah that work contains the entire Oral Law and one needs only to learn

the First Testament and the Mishna Torah and nothing else.

Also, he

writes that the Mishna Torah is for the great and the small (i.e., average

intelligence). This suffices to answer those who try to avoid the Rambam's

point of learning science and philosophy — by making the study of the Torah

longer and harder than it has to be.

He

specifically holds that there was written a code of Jewish law and only for

special reasons were non-halachic opinions added, but theoretically, just a

simple halachic book was all that was needed. So even if there are opinions not

like the Rambam, it would be sufficient to add them to the Mishna Torah, and

not spend all one's life learning that which the Rambam held was almost a waste

of time.

The

Rambam isn't alone in this, for there is also the

Duties of the Heart

that held that going into halachic matters that don't concern one is a complete

waste of time and one rather should learn science and philosophy to come to

love and fear of God.

In

general, I have noticed that modern day Orthodox Judaism is a totally different

religion than that of the Rambam, and the other Jewish Sages of the Medieval

period. To me, that seems ironic, for they claim that the other Jews have gone

off the path.

It seems

that orthodox Judaism has been on a downward-spiral for some time to take the

spirituality out of religion. If you'll notice in Hamlet, that Hamlet felt that

since in his prayer he hadn't succeed to connect with God, that it wasn't

really a prayer. Shakespeare’s whole attitude towards that is that this was in

fact the case, for he considers it ironic that he was spared by seeming to

pray.

So, we

see a general attitude that trying to pray isn't necessarily praying, but in

orthodox Judaism all the prayers are exactly like that, and if one even

attempts to put a little extra into his prayers, he is looked down upon and all

the more so if he tries to pray with the intentions of the Kabbalah.

[Nowadays,

Orthodoxy has become an anti-spiritual movement].

Historically,

I believe we can trace a long progression of Orthodox Judaism attempting to

take spirituality out of the Torah. No longer is God a weighty subject in

Judaism. Now it is the Laws [halacha] for the orthodox, or social justice for

the Reform — but God simply has become a concept that is mentioned for the sake

of lip service.

Thus, we

see that the Sanhedrin in the days of Moses tried to convict him for being a

false prophet [Korach and the heads of the Sanhedrin as Rashi says]. Thus, we

find the Torah establishment of David's time siding with Saul — as the Gemara

Shabbat explains [Doeg was the head of the Sanhedrin]. Thus, we find most of

the rabbis of the Rambam's time trying to excommunicate him, and thus we find

the rabbis of later times condemning the Kabbalah. In all these cases a

generation has to go by, and sometimes much more, until the truth is accepted —

but by then it is sterilized, so as to become non-effective.

Now, all of

them are considered great, but their teachings are ignored when they aren't

politically correct.  Physical mitzvot, to the Rambam, are to provide an environment

for spiritual growth, but do not cause it.

Physical

actions can in no way stimulate internal growth. If knowing lots of laws makes

one spiritual, then Big Blue the computer is more spiritual than all the rabbis

together!

In

yeshivot, it is the accepted way to delve deeply into every word and letter of

the Rambam. I wonder when they will get around to delving into the exact

meaning of “Consequently he who wishes to reach perfection, must first study

Logic, then the different parts of Mathematics in their right order, then

Physics, then Metaphysics”! — and be exacting in every word and every letter.

·

It is a

very worthwhile experience not to get your prayers answered so that you realize

that your prayers and trusting on God and your good deeds can't cause God to do

your will. This is the case no matter how powerful and deep your prayers are.

It is a big ego trip to think that with your prayers you can force him to do

your will. Trust and prayer are good things when done with the right viewpoint

- that God will do what he knows to be the right thing no matter what. But

prayer also can help but only sometimes.

·

There are

two ways of approaching tolerance:

a)

Perhaps tolerance is not a virtue in itself,

but what is wrong with the orthodox is that they forget that the Torah says

don't add to the commandments, and they keep closing the bubble more and more

until there is no room to breathe.  (They, of course don't keep these

standards. They just sin and repent afterwards. But the conventions are useful

in that they provide a way of oppressing everyone else.) Besides that, they are

intolerant of behavior outside of their conventions, which have nothing to do

with the Torah and many times contradict the Torah. But even the non-religious

recognize an outer limit for the bubble. The good thing about the non-religious

is that they have an outer limit and inner limit and so have a pretty good idea

of where to put the limits of behavior. The religious, however, don't recognize

that an inner limit can exist, and they get stricter and make the bubble

smaller and smaller until they condense into the Swartzchild radius of a black

hole from which there is no escape unless, like me, you just come out the other

side. (That is why they and Greek Orthodox wear black clothes to warn people

that they represent a spiritual black hole.)

b)

Another approach is that tolerance is a

virtue in itself and that

God Himself has different standards

for every

person and that even God himself loves tolerance and allows a person a wide

range of opportunity to choose his own behavior within certain limits that

apply that person's soul.

However,

I think there really is not one border-line but two. There is an outer and an inner

limit different for every person, but they fall into a binomial pattern so that

the Torah can state certain basic behavior patterns that are acceptable.

And, besides

this, there is a great interval between the limits where free will and

opportunity exist for growth. The difference between the areas is the gray area

is where tolerance applies, and the white area is simply permitted.

·

The rule

is that teachers of morality can't be moral in people's eyes. God will always

cause a situation to arise where they will seem not moral. This is for the sake

of free-will. Also, it makes it indistinguishable between hypocrites and

sincere teachers which also is necessary for free will.

·

There is

a very basic difference between the Rambam's idea of morality and ethics and

the general religious view. To the general view it is doing what the Torah

says. This view I have ascribed to in much of this book. But, to the Rambam the

criteria

is

Reason.

The Torah

is only to teach us what reason requires. I think ethics is this principle:

doing those actions [or words or thoughts] that are in accord with reason and

the heart. [I think this way was also the Rambam’s intent though he didn't

express it as such.] Thus, there is a certain criteria of reason that if the

heart disagrees it means that one's reason is wrong. There is here a basic

question for the nature of the standards is different.

The

traditional way of looking at the laws of the Torah or morality in general is

that it is some standard rule of conduct, and that theoretically there is some

infinite or finite set of rules for all situations. The Rambam's way is that

there is no external set of rules, only internal rules within each person's

heart and mind that we may be unaware of because of the physicality of the body

that causes us not to hear our minds or heart.

Thus,

there comes a sign to know if someone actually is going to Gan Eden after they

pass away or not. If they have no conscience, i.e., no pangs of guilt when they

cause some type of emotional pain or otherwise to another person, that is a

sign they are completely out of touch with their heart and mind or that their

inner heart and mind have left them and thus they will not go to the light

afterwards. This is the rational

explanation

of the

Ari who said that by anger one loses his soul [i.e., heart and mind]. If they

actually have a tendency to hurt others when the opportunity presents itself,

and there is no external constraint, they are evil and go to hell. The reason

they do this is because they assert only their rights, not others, and thus

come from the breaking of the vessels from which the

kelipot

came. In

Correction all the vessels are together but retain their individual

characteristics. By means of that, the higher light is drawn on them. Good

people come from that world.

Now we

also see that there are different levels of the soul [heart-mind] that react to

different types of sin or lack of good deeds or right knowledge. But we can't

differentiate by the five levels of the Kabbalah since they are horizontal

levels, rather we have to differentiate vertically as Rabbi Sar Shalom Sharabi

did. So, the

nefesh

of each level [i.e.,

nefesh

of

nefesh

or

nefesh

of

ruach

etc...] reacts to bad deeds by guilty feelings

or feels an inner emptiness when there is a lack of good deeds. The foundation

of  nefesh reacts to sexual sin. Kindness of nefesh reacts to kindness, i

.e.,

giving or not giving - but

judgment

of

nefesh

reacts to cruel deeds.

It is a

different subject to the soul. The nefesh of ruach reacts to the inner

spiritual levels of the physical deed

.

Ruach

of

each level reacts to bad words in the above

manner. Neshamah of each level reacts to emotion,

i.e.,

feeling good about feeling love [

i.e., t

he Strange Loop again or what I call the

S

trange

Sp

iral that goes to

infinity], and feeling guilty about feelings of anger. Chaya is for the mind

[feeling good about gaining knowledge] and

Yechidah

is for the soul of the soul, the archetype soul.

[TO THE

RASHASH THE MITZVOT ARE THE INNER GARMENTS OF LIGHT, THE CHARACTER IS THE

GARMENTS OF SKIN OF THE SOUL. HE ALSO DIVIDES THE CHARACTER INTO FOUR MAIN

PARTS.

From

bottom to top it is humility, silence, despising pleasures of the body,

constant happiness in one’s portion. The evil traits are: pride, talking for no

purpose, desire, depression...

The

reason desire is evil is two things. One this is only talking about

kelipat

noga

so it is only evil if one's intention isn't toward God.

The other

reason is that sexual desire in itself is directed towards all females and thus

is a manifestation of the spirit of the species as to increasing the quantity

of the species, not the quality. [This idea is from Schopenhauer]. The reason

that is evil is that simple continuation is kelipat noga, only going up and

improvement relative to one's present position is good.

·

For

mitzvot

that you

don't feel light from you will not get any reward in the next world therefrom.

There really is not all that much difference between here and there. So, if you

don’t feel any light then believe me, there isn't any. This is why the Torah

only promises good in this world for doing the

mitzvot

.

Since the next world is not dependent on

mitzvoth

, only this world is.

However, if you feel the light then in all likelihood you are on the right

track for there too. However, since getting there is such a fragile thing it is

worth it to have a guarantee. So, this is why it is worth it to get to the

grave of Rabbi Nachman, say the ten psalms and give a penny for charity, in

which case he promised he would take that person that does this out of hell, an

unpleasant place by all accounts.

·

It is

forbidden to change one

’s

religion since it is impossible to get the spiritual

blessing except from the root one was born from as already mentioned by the

kabbalists from the Middle Ages. But there is another reason, i.e., that

religion is the images and stories

e

mbedded

into one's

consciousness

when he is young. One

can never change that, nor is it desirable to. One can always stick with his

own religion and just take out the things that are forbidden. True religion

isn't a bunch of rules, it is a way to approach God. And that can only be done

with the totality of

one's

consciousness.

·

Fear of

God is being aware of the presence of God and fearing Him. It is not the same

thing as faith. Faith is Royalty and fear is

Judgment

[and the higher fear {awe} is Wisdom]. Fear is not the same thing as being

strict in observing commandments. In fact, the original idea of Chasidut was

that there is nothing besides God, and that therefore it is possible to serve

God with everything and through everything as long as serving God is one's

intention. It was the first 1960's, where sex and fun and spirituality was all

possible in one package. There is no question that there was much illicit sex

at the beginning of Chasidut [as the affidavits signed in Vilna testify to],

and for this reason the Gra went against the idea that there is nothing but God

until Reb Chayim of Voloshin [his disciple] came and agreed with it, but

explained it in a way that would not contradict the law and thus this idea came

part of the body of accepted doctrine of the Torah. However, to be fair the

original doctrine of Chasidut was not to go against Halacha but rather to

be

as lenient

as possible since fear of God has nothing

to do with being strict.

The idea

of

chassidus

as taken

by people in general was do what you want and intend it for God and that is

accepted by God as Divine service [as long as you don't do evil] since there is

nothing besides God and everything is God. It was “Serve God by having fun,” [i.e.,

serve God with joy/fun].

This

wasn't appreciated by the Gra and most rabbis. When they would go on the street

and ask the youth why are you behaving so wildly the answer wasn't ‘Go to

hell,’ but rather, “This is our Divine service.” Giving a spiritual motive to

have fun was unappreciated by the Gra. To a degree this was rightly so since

just like the Flower Children of the 60s’ deteriorated into the Yuppies of the

70s’, so the movement of

chassidus

reversed its polarity from super spiritual to super

material until today it is the worship of money and power.

·

One of

the benefits of there being religious people even though they are jerks is that

the gate into holiness would be closed by the klipot completely if they weren't

standing in the door. So even though the religious are themselves an obstacle

to the service of God still they benefit us by keeping the door open.

·

There is

a normal distribution of how many people [Jewish, Christian, etc] can or should

be religious. This is because there are ten sephirot and the sepherah of piety

is Judgement. The orthodox are Judgement, which is 10% of all Jews [However, a

recent study shows the orthodox are about 7% of American Jews.] The Rashi that

explains that people should not try to keep all the

mitzvot

[because if they would, then no one would merit to the

next world] was written for those people who are not allowed to be religious,

for being religious isn't their root and it is forbidden for them to try to be

religious and it would hurt them spiritually if they would try.

·

The

Gemara in Macot 24A says, ‘Rabbi Simlai expounded

:

613

commandments were said to Moses...

·

[King] David came and established them on

11...

·

Isaiah came and established them on 6...

·

Micah came and established them on 3....

·

Isaiah then established them on 2...

·

Amos came and established them on 1…

Rashi

writes, “[…] Established them on 11.” For, at first people were righteous and

could bear the yoke of many commandments, but the later generations were not so

righteous and if they would try to keep them all no one would merit. So, David

came and established them on 11.”

Rashi is

clear. However, the other first authorities explain this Gemarah differently.

Now, to show you that I am not making up my own explanation of Rashi, look at

the Marsha who says on this Rashi, “the question is famous,” and then he brings

the explanation of another first authority. However, this doesn't detract from

the fact that Rashi wrote what he wrote. This does show however that even the

Marsha understood Rashi as saying what it is obvious what he is saying.

Isn't it

clear that Rashi knew the verses of the Torah that say the Mitzvot are forever?

Obviously, yes. So, we must say that Rashi held those verses apply only to the

specific commandment that the verse is referring to there, e.g., if the Torah

says the two loaves or the Shabbat are forever then we know that those mitzvot

are eternal. But why doesn't it say this by other mitzvot? It must be that the

other mitzvot

are

not eternal. [Otherwise, why say

it by some and not others? And the verse in Haazinu [Deut. 29:28] says to do

all the words of the Torah forever, but not to do

mitzvot

that were

given only for a certain time period forever. For instance, if a person would

sit in a

sukkah

on chanukah, he would not have a mitzvah. If you do a

mitzvah after

its

time period is over, you

also have no mitzvah. So, in Rashi's explanation, King David said the time to

keep the mitzvot that were not eternal is over. But he was not referring to

mitzvot like the Shabbat, which are. It seems to me

that the Mitzvot

mentioned in connection with the land of Israel are

eternal since the Torah gives them in order that we should inherit the land of

Israel

forever.

Now there

is a difference of opinion if the commandments are a goal in themselves. If we

take the Baal HaTanya's point of view, then one way to resolve that Rashi

,

except to say that the Baal HaTanya must hold like the

other

R

ishonim that explain that Gemara

differently. However, the

perush

on the Rambam explains that lower fear

of God [fear of punishment] is to bring one to the

mitzvot

and the

mitzvot

are to bring one to the higher fear [awe of God]. According to this Rashi it

comes out well. For since the commandments are specifically to bring one to awe

of God and King David [and the later prophets] saw that in their

generation

the

mitzvot

did not cause awe of God. Perhaps

that caused him to realize the time period was over.

·

The Baal

Shem Tov was given by the Messiah three things to do, and three unifications -

that if people would do them, the Messiah would come. I would like to take a

guess as to what they might be based on the things that the Baal Shem Tov

himself was careful in, i.e.:

1)

Mikvah

2)

Praying at sunrise

3)

Learning in the way of just saying the words

quickly and without repeating anything.

I would

guess the things to learn would be the four categories that the Arizal said to

learn every day, i.e., the Bible, Halacha, Gemara,

Kabbalah

. (The Rambam held that science is in the category of

Gemara. So, this turns out to be the Bible, Halacha, Science,

Kabbalah

.

The three

unifications I would guess are the names 72,42 and 12.

Chapter 5 - Happiness

“Life

without pleasure is impossible.”

–

Thomas Aquinas

·

Happiness

is the result of motion upward or inward, which depends on

one's

upward or inward energy. Some people have only upward

energy, and some have energy that drives them inward. But there is a law of

conservation of energy which results in the law of conservation of happiness.

Only a certain amount of happiness is granted to one. But by association with

others, one reaches a state of equilibrium with them. If they are unhappy then

eventually one’s happiness gets dissipated by them. But by prayer, learning

Torah and Wisdom, and kindness you can draw more from God (but you can't create

it yourself). Each of these (or any service connected with the ten Divine

sephirot), draws with it, when done in connection with God, a certain light and

happiness related to its own sepherah and also brings with it a special

physical blessing, e.g., kindness brings love into one's life, sexual purity

brings sex (i.e. not to have sex in a wrong way tends to bring sex in the right

way). A result of this law is that great pleasure and great pain always come

together so that the equilibrium will be preserved. An example of this is the

Kennedy family.

·

There is

another conservation law of spiritual energy, that if you spend it on one thing

you won't have it for something else; so, choose wisely. Try to spend it on

things that will draw further energy from the Source, i.e., good deeds. [Using

one's spiritual energy is what Rabbi Nachman means by praying with strength.

Yet, because of the law of conservation of spiritual energy, one should be

careful how he uses it and conserve it for important things and not use it all

up on small things].

·

Rabbi

Nachman says that it is always an important commandment to be happy [in God].

So, if you have a doubt about if you should do something or not, i.e., if it's

God's

will or not, then look at the happiness factor. If it's

there, then it's God's will. [I think that the translation from Rabbi Nachman's

Yiddish into the Hebrew aphorism that “It is a great mitzvah to be happy

always”, is a mistranslation for there is no such mitzvah. Rather he meant, “It

is always a great mitzvah to be happy”- i.e., to be happy and rejoice in the

Lord.

The

Gemarah in Avoda Zara asks on the contradiction between the verses in Kohelet,

where King Solomon praises happiness in one and puts it down in the other… It

answers that happiness in God is a good thing, happiness not in God is not

.

The reason for this is

that h

appiness is

klipat noga

[the tree of knowledge of

good and evil], so when it is in God it becomes included in holiness and the

bad in it falls away. But depression is from the three totally evil klipot. Therefore

any depression is evil.

·

Now you

could ask about Mozart and Beethoven or artists in general where it seems a bit

of unhappiness stirred and inspired their best creations. On one level you can

answer that

their experiences were unhappy, not their attitude. Also

,

Rabbi Shneur Zalman explained that judgements come

from a higher source than blessings so when one stays attached to God in the

long run the judgements turn into the highest blessings.

“Nothing

that is vast enters into the life of mortals without a curse.” -Sophocles.

Heisenberg

was embarrassed at his oral exam for his P.H.D. when he didn't know how to work

out the resolution of a microscope, and he had to go and re-learn it. When the

next year he developed

Matrix

Mechanics

[or quantum mechanics] the subject of

resolution became a powerful tool to show the truth of the uncertainty

principle.

There was

a young woman accused of communists ties and her reputation ruined and almost

lost her job. She went to the president of the company to ask him to stick up

for her. He took an interest in her and besides helping her keep her job he

married her. She became the first lady of the

USA, the

wife of President George Bush.

·

Aristotle

had a basic philosophy of happiness that I would like to write down in summary

form in order to show the logical basis for why it is important to keep the

mitzvot

.

Socrates

said, “An unexamined life is not worth living.” Aristotle said, “An unplanned

life is not worth examining”. He

held that one

has

to have a plan. But not any plan will do. He held that there is only one right

plan. If one lives by the wrong plan, he will not have a good life. Now there

are things we do just to live. But there are other things we do in order to

live well,

i.e., achieve

happiness and enrich

our lives. But we live in order to live well,

i.e., to

have happiness. Who could say that they don't want

happiness? Happiness is the highest goal. People are happy because they have

what they want. Yet we all have different wants. But in truth though we want

different

things, living

well is really the

same for us all.

There are

things that we want and things that we need. The need for food and the need for

knowledge are human needs. Some things we want aren't good for us but things we

need

are

always

good for us. The need for food we feel but

there are other needs that we don't feel so readily. The one right plan for

living is to seek and acquire the things that are really good for us, the

things we need to live and the things we need to live well. Thus, happiness is

really the same for everybody. It is to acquire the things that are really good

for us to have.

These are

external needs of the body and internal needs of the mind. The mind by reason

of its nature needs to know. Thus there are the goods of the mind such as

knowledge and skills and especially the skill of thinking.

There is

also the need of the heart to love and be loved. Also there is the need for

self-esteem and honor if it is honor for the right reasons. [I believe there is

also a human need for freedom.]

There is

also another kind of need, the need of the soul for good habits or virtues,

i.e., the habit of choosing the virtuous thing without having to go through a

difficult process every time a situation comes up: as in temperance and

courage.

The

reason God gave us the Torah is to teach us the virtues of the mind [right

opinions] and of the soul and good habits, i.e., to receive the needs of the

body and soul.

Now there

is another need that Aristotle didn't mention and that is the need to work for

a goal. Every human being has this, as Victor Frankel said [I think from Nietzsche],

“Give a man a reason to live and he will find the how to live.”

But this

is, in a sense, included in Aristotle since happiness is a constant process of acquiring

more things than one needs. The needs of the body are finite, but the need of

the soul is infinite, since the soul needs God — and acquiring more knowledge

of God or his works is an infinite process. At any rate, happiness is the

feeling one gets from movement upwards or inward as I wrote before.

But just

any goal isn't enough. It has to be the right goal. The right goal — Aristotle

has already explained — is to get our needs met. Thus, it seems we have

circular reasoning [The Strange Loop].

The

answer to this, however, is that Man [as a society and also individual men]

need to work as an upward spiral [The Strange Spiral].

First

getting the physical needs met, then the emotional, then the mental and then

spiritual. But each individual may have a particular need which he feels more

strongly than the others — and thus some people work on the spiritual at the

expense of the physical. The reason for this is that this spiral is usually for

the community as a whole. Some people work on one need and others on another

but in the whole society everyone benefits.

Free-will

is when a person has the choice of determining whether he wants to work on a

higher or lower need. Thus, a need can be evil if a person can work on a higher

need and instead chooses the lower one, or it can be neither good nor evil if

one is only able to work on it alone, or it can be good if a person has to

choose between it and a lower need.

The idea

of the Strange Loop is that a system that refers to itself must be incomplete,

like the electron that acts on itself. The whole creation on every level is

filled with the strange. The reason is, I think, like Hegel saw, they drive us

toward a higher level. So, the puzzle of Quantum Mechanics that physicists to

this day cannot figure out is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of the

mathematical reality of Creation.

G

ö

del's theorem shows there

is a fundamental limitation to any formal self-consistent system that refers to

itself. In fact, Hofstadter pointed out that any understanding of the human

mind will force us to accept “causes that propagate both upwards and downwards

in the Tangled Hierarchy of mentality....”

Incidentally

the

Lekutai Moharan

of Rabbi Nachman is also filled with these loops as

Rabbi Nathan pointed out, like sexual purity and prayer depending one on the

other, etc. There is a way to get the infinite spirals of logic to converge by

means of the idea of the improper integral that converges, i.e., if we could

find the formula for any one of these spirals we could see if they can converge

to a definite sum by integrating them.

Now this

is related to politics in the following way: Living in a good society is

necessary for happiness because the plan and organization of a society can be

helpful to attain this happiness (or a hindrance, as I have mentioned). Not all

forms of government are good for this goal. The type of government necessary

for happiness is a democracy, since the government that is good helps the

people achieve happiness.

Thus, the

Torah gives the people the prerogative to appoint a King. A government that

serves the bureaucracy is not a good government. Since people are created with

equality, all should have an equal chance to advance themselves - not just

those that are part of the government. A government is not good that treats

equals as unequal's and gives unfair advantage to one person over another by

free hand outs to one group or another. The real goods that we need, like

virtue and courage, are largely dependent on our individual decisions. The

government should not tax one group to give to another, for that is not

treating people equally. Only in the case of deprivation, that some people

suffer because of some misfortune not in their power to control, should the government

help. The State can only supply the conditions of peace necessary for

happiness, but it can't make people happy, or even be sure that the people will

make the right decisions. To expect the government to do more is to invite

tyranny. However, there must be a body of judges to counterbalance the effect

of the democracy since in any free society there is a class of unskilled labor

that are going to feel disenfranchised financially and in other ways by the

establishment and who feel they have nothing to lose by disrupting the system,

so they become anti­-morality since they feel morality is simply to serve the

rich. They feel they have a right to other people's money. This class can

become powerful enough to destroy the society and thus the Torah supports a

balanced system.

This

disagrees with Hegel in that the study of history isn't just a way of coming to

the right government or coming to freedom. However, Hegel’s idea is rooted in

Kabbalah and especially that of Rabbi Shneur Zalman that the combining of Tohu

and Tikun leads to them coming up to and being included in the Name 63 which is

the root of Freedom. Thus, the plan of the Torah is to create a space for each

individual where they can grow and keep the mitzvot and not be infringed upon

by society at large, and yet still be a part of the whole. I think the level

after that is to come to the name 72 which is happiness or attachment with God

which is higher than freedom. [The fact that the human being has needs of the

spirit not just of the body is one reason Marx's material dialectics is

mistaken. Hegel at least had the intelligence to see the motivating force of

history is the quest of the Spirit for freedom [the name 63] but I believe that

there is a level after that of Attachment with God [the name 72] which is a

need of the soul.

The Baal Shem Tov Quoted Rav Saadiyah Gaon as saying, “It is

proper for a person to desire all physical things for from thence he will come

to desire Torah and the service of God.” This goes along with the Rambam in

Moreh Nevuchim that one who is feeling down should sit among the “Lovely forms”

and listen to music. [This gave some people at the beginning of the movement of

Chasidut to be somewhat promiscuous.] But this is clearly the idea of serving

God by everything since there is nothing besides God and everything is God, and

there is no evil in the world at all.

Chapter 6 – Reward and

Punishment

·

Doing the

mitzvot

physically only brings physical blessing as the Torah says, “I

will give rain in its season”. Only doing the spiritual essence of the

mitzvot

brings spiritual blessing and enlightenment.

·

“Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a

house hath once been shaken from heave, there the curse fails nevermore,

passing from life to life… by folly in speech, and frenzy at the heart. Evil

seems good to him whose mind the God draws to mischief; and but for the

briefest space doth he

fare

free of woe.” -

Sophocles in

Antigone

(i.e., any person with judgements upon them tends

to do evil things almost against their will just so that the evil judgements

will have something to come upon.)

·

Rabbi

Issac Luria says that the generations from Adam to Noah who were evil were

reborn at the time of the flood to receive their punishment in this world. They

were 600,000 root souls. The generations before the dispersion and the tower of

Babylon were those same souls and had sinned during that ten-generation period.

Similarly, the generations before the destruction of the 1

st

Temple.

And similarly, the generations before the Holocaust. And in the opinion of

Rabbi Luria even if one was sinful in a prior life, once born again, he won't

suffer for those sins if he lives properly. As the Zohar says about Job -- he

wouldn't have suffered if he had brought peace offerings (parts of which are

divided amongst the poor) instead of burnt offerings. This is even though he

was Terach (who was an idolator) in a previous life. And that is why Rabbi

Luria also says that he wouldn't have suffered if he had gone to Abraham to

learn the ways of loving kindness. If we go by the opinion of Rabbi Luria, we

will have to conclude that being religious isn't the same as being righteous

for Job was religious, but he wasn't concerned enough about the poor to be

righteous. In Hebrew, this is the difference between being righteous and being

a saint.

·

If you knew

all that you need then you wouldn't have free will. So, God makes sure you

don't. Your true character can be revealed only when you don't know all the

facts about your situation and how your actions affect events, and you must

decide anyway how to act. But when one correctly knows the situation then he

has no free will, and thus no reward and punishment and is just a clay in the

hands of the artisan. But still the revealing of the traits doesn't happen in

his way. And the free will was made for there to be the revealing of one's

character traits. However even those totally in

Yiddishkeit

or Jesus or

science, God seems to make sure that many things ever that are not known which

can easily be seen by others so that there should still be free will in these

things.

·

People's

impression that big things happen in their lives because of very small things

is true as the formula:

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

tells us, i.e., that a small

variation between certain numbers can cause substantial changes. But eventually

one comes down from the world of

chaos

into the world of probability

where things

average

out into a nice binomial

function - farther from the light but closer to the vessels that can hold

whatever light one may have.

·

The

reason there is suffering before each new level of wisdom is that the sephirot

of Akudim before they reach a higher level must turn their backs to face upward,

so the higher light comes through their backs. Then, as they reach the higher

level, they turn around again to face forward to us and there is a higher

revelation of light but during the time they were rising there was only the

backward light (red shifted).

·

There

have been people that accomplished great good in the world yet suffered

enormously as a result of it. This is because the higher light comes dressed in

judgements.

·

Nietzsche

held that according to the Bible, God saves the righteous, period. No ‘ifs’, ‘ands’

or ‘buts’. Yet I have a way of answering for the Sages. [The opinion of the

Sages is that God rewards those who have a majority [in quality] of sin with good

things in this world and punishes their sins in the next. This is to reward

them for their good deeds in a temporary world. The reason is because if they

are mainly sinful God gives them their main reward in the world which is the

main and most important, i.e., the next world. Those that have a majority of

good deeds God rewards them in the next world for their good deeds and punishes

them here for their bad deeds. Thus, one who is mainly good will suffer unless

he has no sin at all. Now this is certainly in accord with Genesis - but I

would like to say that it also goes along with the rest of the Torah. For, the

places in the Torah where it guarantees reward for good deeds is always in

plural and referring to the Jewish people as a whole. So, it only is saying if

the 51% of the people are good, then 51% will have good. They might be 49% of

the bad and 2% of the good who will have good. At any rate in this world the

evil people succeed and have money, children, and happiness. Yet, God gives

good to the righteous eventually by preserving them, even if it is in a lowly

way and by raising their horn [honor and happiness in the end.]

·

If the

majority of one's deeds are good, he is rewarded in the

Gan Eden

of

Earth by the light of God shining upon him here and punished for his bad deeds

in this life by bad events. If the majority of one's deeds are evil, he will be

punished in hell and here on Earth have physical comfort. However, for good

words one is rewarded in the lower Gan Eden and punished for his bad words in

this world if the majority of his words are good in quantity and quality. If

the majority are lies or evil talk, he is punished in hell and rewarded for his

good words here. If the majority of his thoughts and feelings are good, then he

is rewarded for them in the higher

Gan Eden

.

Chapter 7 – Eras of Man

“Not only the body, but also the soul whose habits, tempers,

opinions, desires, pleasures, fears never remain the same… and this is equally

true of knowledge… not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay… but

each of them individually experiences a like change.”

-Plato Symposium

·

MANKIND

PROGRESSED DOWNWARD THROUGH TIME. UNTIL JESUS WAS HIT AT THE ORIGIN. Then we

came out to the other side continuing in the same direction but now progressing

towards the light instead of away.

·

“At the

time of dusk there will be light.” The Zohar explained that this refers to the

272 years before the 6th millennium of the Hebrew calendar which comes out to

be the year 1968.

·

During

the 6th 1000-year period there was a flow on the level of Foundation which is

from 1240 until 2240. (3760 B.C. is the beginning of the 1st thousand.) This

would explain the flow of wisdom since then. And the Rambam's saying in the

letter to Yemen that prophesy would start then.

·

This is leading

up to the 7th thousand-year

period starting 2240. This is similar to the 1

st

thousand were to

draw from the previous “Sabbath” on thousand years while our period is to draw

from the coming thousand-year period.

•

Every

hundred years is a blessing in a different field as a part of the process of

the redemption of mankind.

●

1400-1500 was art.

●

From 1500 to 1600 was the Reformation.

●

From 1600 to 1700 was Mathematics Philosophy.

●

From 1700 - 1800 was Music.

●

From 1850 - 1950 was invention.

●

1900 - 2000 was Physics.

[an

art-religion-science -philosophy cycle.]

This doesn't mean that at the end of the period the blessing has

to stop. It can continue but not in the same way as a massive overflowing. This

refers to the circular

sephirot

of the non-Jews whose spiritual

redemption started from Jesus. But the Jewish hundred-year periods start on the

forty-year mark.

Thus:

·

1240-1340 - Royalty - [the writings of Abulafia and the other

Kabbalists].

·

1340-1440 - Foundation.

·

1440-1540 - Splendor - which is a time of judgement and thus was

the expulsion from Spain.

·

1540-1640 – Victory – Kabbalah - Rabbi Issac Ashkenazi and Spinoza

who proved God and discovered the logical proofs of the system of the Torah.

(However, since he was excommunicated, it hasn't been used as such).

·

1640-1740 Torah-Beauty - The Ramchal, the Gra and the Baal Shem

Tov, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzera and Rabbi Shalom Sharabi - all the sages of Torah

that all Torah (learning and keeping) until today is based on.

·

1740-1840 – Judgement - the fall of the Jewish people away from

the Torah yet still there was the counter force of Rabbi Nachman and the other

great sages that continued the different movements mentioned above.

·

1840-1940 – Kindness - return to Israel (Royalty) and emigration

to America (Foundation).

·

1940-2040 - Understanding - This implies the awakening of

judgements (the Holocaust), freedom [i.e., the 1960s], and

Understanding

itself.

·

2040-3040 - Wisdom.

·

3040-4040 - Crown. [The implication of all this is that World War

III should start around 2010 which is Understanding of Understanding.]

·

·

In the

1960's there existed the wisdom to understand that the establishment needed to

be either reformed or thrown out (that's the disagreement between “The Greening

of America” and Ayn Rand. But there was also in the air the rebellion against

parents. This danger doesn't exist now because in the air there is all the talk

about strengthening the family. But this talk didn't exist then. The children

of today's children will have the same test since time is circular. How can we

make sure the coming 1960s will not decay into the yuppie 1970's? and not be a

rebellion against all moral values, rather than just against false ones. The

answer is the basis (religion) must be strong- but not fanatical; just solid.

We need a religious and philosophic basis for the world. That is knowledge of the

Bible and the Talmud and the great philosophers, and religious giants of

history like Buddha, the Gita, Jesus, Rabbi Nachman, etc. We need to bring the

Bible back to the world.

·

The

problem with the hippies was that they needed to provide a viable alternative

to the establishment, which really doesn't exist. Their economic ideal of

communism has shown itself to be a non-workable option. Their major benefit was

to shake things up so that reform within the system could take place, which

wouldn't have happened without them. They made the reduction of the cold war to

be the goal. Although President Reagan accomplished it in a way they would not

have agreed with; but at least it stopped. Without that the world would at some

point been destroyed a couple times over. They accomplished reform in education

so that the education of the 60s was individually oriented.

·

At the

time of the destruction of the first Temple, the secrets of the Torah went into

exile and were scattered all over the world. That is why Pythagoras, Buddha,

Plato, Socrates and so many other spiritual and intellectual giants appeared on

the scene at that point.

·

There

have to be two protagonists in every generation, each correct and true - but

from the opposing worlds of Chaos and Correction, and therefore in conflict

with each other:

●

Einstein and Heisenberg

●

The Baal Shem Tov and the Gra

●

Dr. Spock and Dr Vincent Peal (The Power of positive Thinking),

Plato and Aristotle, Hillel and Shamai. But this is only after the house of

King David was split for before that there was power in the righteous[tikun the

sephirot of correction] to contain the two opposites [i.e., the light of

correction and of chaos, freedom].

·

The

Talmud says that in the year 6000 (2240 in the English calendar) God will

destroy the world, people will fly on wings 1000 years and then in the year

7000 there will be the revival of the dead and a renewal of this world. Perhaps

the wings the Talmud refers to are spacecraft? [Is it possible we will live on

other planets? I have heard that perhaps travel faster than light is possible

if done like the traveling of energy in a rope that isn’t shaken up and down so

that the energy travels in waves but rather pulled so that the energy travels

in a faster way.]

·

People

haven't traveled back to us in time yet because to the

Shemita

opinion

time comes in layers and the future layers haven't come yet into existence (the

future doesn't yet exist.)

·

Mankind

goes through harmonic motion (something like

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

). Similarly,

each

nation and individual. That is why this century

has had

accelerated harmonic motion with the progress of democracy and freedom; yet

also world wars and depressions. I would suggest that A isn't a constant but

gets smaller with time, so the harmonic motion gets more accentuated.

I don't

think accepting Jesus would have saved the Jewish nation at the second Temple

period because if so, it should have done so for the Roman empire 300 years

later. Yet we see the Roman Empire disintegrated into nothing starting

immediately after they accepted Jesus. Thus, it seems to me that the events

surrounding Jesus were as planned. According to the translation of Wise and

Eisen that is in fact exactly what the prophet Isaiah if fact predicted. But it

is likely that the destruction would have taken a less violent turn - as with

the Romans the destruction of the nation meant dissolving the political unity,

not the mass destruction of the people as it did for the Jewish people at the

time of the destruction of the Temple.

·

If we go

by Hegel’s idea of religion and philosophy, I think we should be entering on a

new age of religion that will be an improvement from the last ages for this coming

one will include each religion retaining its identity yet integrating the good

aspects of others.

·

Abraham

gave to his seven children from the later wives “presents” and sent them to the

East. I think this is the

Vedic

knowledge.

The

Indus-Saraswati civilization had undergone decay from natural disasters. The

arrival of the Vedic people around 1700-1500 BC right after the life of Abraham

[which was at the beginning of the second millennium BC] was a rejuvenation —

for they brought with them the teachings of Abraham.

This

explains to me the fact of their strong monotheistic traditions though they

still have idolatry and other dualistic traditions. I think this may explain

from where they got the idea of meditation which I think is a well-established

principle in all religious thought, yet clearly the East got it much before the

West.

If it

wasn't from Abraham, then clearly it must have been from some spiritual giant.

Even

Judaism today doesn't compare with it, for Judaism has become an anti­spiritual

religion by its strictest adherents and obviously it must at least be able to

lend itself to an anti-spiritual interpretation. While the

Vedas

are the

most spiritual books that exist in terms of their search for enlightenment and

not being able to take anything less as a substitute, even prayer, good deeds,

study or even meditation. The Vedas can lend themselves to idolatry but

certainly not to anti­spirituality.

·

One's

place in the world is largely determined by the place one has in the large

events of each of the ten sephirot. For, like in Math there is a constant

progression upward and it is the job of the mathematician to add more bricks to

the building of knowledge, not just to understand it, thus it is with all the

ten sephirot. Thus

There are

in each group [and there are many more groups] periods of blackholes when no

progress is made. Sometimes progress is horizontal and sometimes it is vertical.

Horizontal progress is also important since it adds to the base.

Chapter 8 – The Redemption

“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my

attention?”

“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”

“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”

“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.

“Everything

is dependent on Kabbalah. Our lack of involvement with it causes the delay of

the building of the Temple.” “…and when we will repent on this and occupy

ourselves with this wisdom (Kabbalah), the Jewish people will be redeemed.”

(-Rabbi Chayim Vital in Introduction of the Eitz Chayim.) Rabbi Moshe Chayim

Lutzato writes along the same lines in the

Pri Eitz Chayim.

INTRODUCTION

The redemption

is one of the most painful subjects. All Israel expected the Messiah to come at

the end of the second Temple period and deliver them from the Romans. This was

correct to expect, since the prophets that predicted the destruction of the First

Temple clearly imply that when the Second would be built that the Messiah would

then come then, and that it would last forever. Well — that prediction proved

wrong.

Then,

after its destruction they were expecting Bar Kochba to deliver them — that

also didn't work. Then there were predictions in the

Gemara

that proposed

some dates within a hundred years. Then the First Authorities placed their

predictions for a hundred years after their time. Then, we got an assortment of

saints that tried to bring the

Geulah

themselves and all failed. Then,

Chabad got into the Messiah business and in fact made a lot of money doing so.

·

The

Messiah revealed the same idea to the Baal Shem Tov in his vision on Rosh

HaShanah when the Baal Shem Tov asked “when will you come?” He answered “By

this you will

know:

when your wells will overflow

and they will be able to do

unifications

and rise

to higher worlds like you, then will be a time of grace and salvation. “The

teachings of the Baal Shem Tov to a large degree are contained in the books of

his disciples. Rabbi Nachman never claimed that his teachings stemmed from them

but in fact Rabbi Nachman gives the handles by which it is possible for every

person to hold on to the lessons of the Baal Shem Tov.

The Baal

HaTanya created a different path which I consider to be valid but certainly not

related to Chasidut. For example, the Baal HaTanya

deemphasized

the importance of the “rebbi

”

which the Besht held was

essential. Also, the Besht gave the path of when one sees a beautiful girl to

raise the trait of

Beauty

to its higher root,

which the Baal Hatanya dismissed for people in general. The idea of “There is

nothing besides God” of the Baal Hatanya is also different from the Besht. To

the Besht it is like Shankara, i.e., literally nothing but God. Everything is

God. There is nothing but his infinite Light. But to the Baal Hatanya

everything is “as if it is nothing and nullified like a ray of light in the

sun.” There is a whole book in the Yeshivat HaKotel which goes further into the

discrepancy between the idea of the Oneness of God of the Besht and the Baal

Hatanya which I just skimmed over. What I wrote is from my own understanding of

this, but that book went much deeper. The other things I mentioned are in some

article in the Library of Hebrew University.]

·

Doing the

unifications of the Ari means to go to a quiet place and to concentrate on God

and his Divine names. It is the same idea as the meditation of the Bhagavad

Gita except that the Gita just talks about concentrating on the Oneness of God

while the unifications of the Ari give vessels to contain the light in.

·

However,

you may ask, doesn't this apply only to higher souls and people who have filled

themselves with the Talmud and legal authorities? Rabbi Chayim Vital writes in

the introduction to the Eitz Chayim, “The dull person who can't understand the

Talmud after having tried it should leave it and learn only Kabbalah,  however

a smart person is required for one or two hours a day to the study of Halacha

and to intend to answer the questions that fall upon the Halacha, and

afterwards he should intend to dress the bride - which is the Wisdom of the

Kabbalah.” The Ramchal writes along the same lines in his books. The age of

forty for Kabbalah isn't mentioned by any major authorities and only brought as

an anonymous “some people say” in the Shach. However, the Rambam does say to be

filled with Talmudic learning before learning Kabbalah which, the Shelah

HaKadosh says, means to fill yourself with Talmudic learning “that day”, before

you learn Kabbalah.

·

According

to Rabbi Chayim Vital, the redemption depends on Kabbalah (the secrets of the

Torah), not chasidut, not Musar, not Halacha, not Gemara, etc. Others have

different answers to bring the redemption. Nothing has helped and still the

redemption isn't here and still the sole and single advice of Rabbi Chayim

Vital isn't done. He wrote that 500 years ago and it's still not done. All the

Musar and Chassidus and Halacha haven't helped. Maybe Kabbalah is dangerous but

nothing else has done better. And still the one simple piece of advice of Rabbi

Chayim Vital isn't done - learn Kabbalah all day and the redemption will come.

If

we don’t it’s clear that the redemption won't come

(t

his section refers to the spiritual redemption not the

political one even though they are in fact closely related for no matter how

much political progress is made if it isn't coupled with God, it has little

worth as America is proving so well nowadays as it rapidly sinks into

totalitarianism).

As to the

idea of drawing the light of that coming period closer which problem is on the

mind of many, I have a few suggestions

:

1.)

In the book Heichal HaBracha it says the

author heard from a great Kabbalist that finding the Ark of the Covenant and

putting it in

its

proper place on the temple mount would bring the final

redemption immediately. The Ark is buried somewhere deep beneath the surface.

2.)

Rav Acha son of Rava said God will renew this

world after the year 5000 (

i

n the Hebrew calendar)

,

i.e., 1240 A.D. (Sanhedrin 97b). (Rabbi A. Abulafia

was born Rosh HaShanah of that year) (Khan took Kiev that year and was well on

his way to severely shake up all Christendom and the Islamic empires and China.

His progress was halted in (of all places) the land of Israel!

It is interesting to note that the Rambam writes that

prophecy would be restored to Israel at that time. It seems to me that Rav Acha

was referring to the emergence of the Renaissance and the Kabbalah at that period.

3.)

Rabbi Eliezer said the days of the Messiah

will be 40 years (Sanhedrin 99a). If we go by the 6000 year opinion that means

Messiah will come in the year 2200 AD., [about 200 years from now

].

4.)

Rabbi Chiya son of Aba said in the name of

Rabbi Yochanan, “all the prophets prophesied only for the days of the Messiah,

but as for the next world no

‘

eye has seen it

’

, and this disagrees with Shmuel for Shmuel said

, “

there is no difference between this world and the days of

the messiah except for enslavement of Israel to the nations.” Shmuel is saying

that all the prophecies of the Bible about the days of the Messiah are

referring to the time of the revival of the dead and don

’

t refer to this world at all at any point. [That is the

same spiritual realm where the stories of Rabbah Bar Bar Chanah took place.]

This

is clearly the intention of the Gemara which says that Rabbi Yochanan and

Shmuel disagree. This would mean that the Temple and the gathering of the

exiles all refer to the higher realm. This would correspond the prophecies of

Yechezkeil that the return from the Babylonian exile was the final redemption

and that in the higher spiritual plane there already exists the Temple and all

the souls of Israel are in the higher land of Israel. This would answer the

question on Rav Hillel for the prophecies that took place after Hezkia the King

were referring to the higher world. This would explain the Zohar that the Gates

of the Higher and Lower Wisdom would be opened up in the year 5600 (about 1840)

by which time all the major saints of the Jewish people were gone, e.g., Rabbi

Nachman, the Baal Hatanya, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzaira etc. Rather the intention

is that in this lower world the Gates of the Lower Wisdom and in the higher

world the gates of the Higher Wisdom would be opened up.

5.)

Rabbi Dosa said the days of the Messiah would

be 400 years which puts it at the year 1840, which is the beginning of the Age

of Invention.

6.)

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said, 365 years, which

puts it around the birth of Albert Einstein and Rabbi Israel Abuchatzera.

7.)

Rav Hillel says, “There will be no Messiah

for Israel, for they already enjoyed it [that period] in the days of Chezkia”

(Sanhedrin 99-A).

8.)

“The redemption of Israel will be like the

rising of the sun” [Midrash], i.e.

,

slowly but

surely, and during that period it gets so light that you think the sun will

rise in a minute when in reality it is still very far away. And by the time the

sun really is ready to rise it is already so bright that it is almost

irrelevant if you can see the sun or not. When the whole world will be filled

with the brightness and glory of God then I will know that messiah is

near

. Until then I will just have to wait.

·

Since in

every level of creation there are two Strange Loops

: o

ne that takes one up and the other that takes one down to

the lower level [like the double helix of the DNA],

thus,

to come to the redemption one needs to find the Strange

Loop for the present level. But the present level consists of ten sephirot.

For

instance

,

t

he religious level has this strange loop

that

t

he more you get into it the more you find it implies

Jesus, but Jesus in the

New

Testament said

things

contradictory

to

the

Torah, at least on the face of it. But then again, he said

keep the whole Torah with exactitude. This works for all saints also. Like

getting involved with the Gra or Rabbi Nachman will

inevitably

lead to self-contradictions. This may seem to lead in

circles but in fact they

lead

to the next

higher level.

Chapter 9 – On Learning Torah

·

It

is

clear that the Torah puts learning on a higher level than

doing good deeds. The actual idea is that deeds create the vessels to receive

the light. Since all Israel in their higher root are one

, if

someone whose root is from the world of

Action

is available to do the good deed and create the vessel,

it's

better for one whose root is in learning to sit and learn

and to draw the light. The philosophy of the Torah puts learning Torah above

prayer. The way to explain Rabbi Nachman is that speaking with God in a

personal way isn't the same thing as prayer, rather it is fulfilling the

command of being attached to God which is higher than Torah

,

prayer and good deeds and it is the light of the name 72.

·

In

learning Torah, or all learning in general,

it's

best to speak

out the words

quickly

and to say them in order

with no repeats or interruptions. Only when one has finished the whole book

should he then to go back and review it (as Rabbi Nachman said). It's also

helpful to say the words forward and backwards [i.e., to go to the end of the

page and then to go backwards] as is clear in the

Annulment of Judgements

of the Baal Shem Tov HaKadosh and in the unifications of Rabbi Luria to remove

bad spirits in the

Shaar Ruach Hakodesh

and in the corrections of Rabbi

Yehudah HaCHasid and the reason this helps is stated in the

Tikunim

HaChadashim

of the Ramchal and the

Eitz Chayim

of Rabbi Luria.

[I have

also found it useful for me to learn lying down on my back for light books and

on my stomach with the book on a lower surface for heavy books]. Rabbi Nachman

noticed an important part of human intelligence: its unique ability to see

over-all patterns. This is largely a subconscious process — and thus Rabbi

Nachman knew that the main absorption of learning is simply by reading —

whether one is aware of his understanding or not.

This is

dependent however on the type of light contained in what one is learning. For

Hebrew only contains inner light. The outer surrounding-light of Hebrew was

lost and has gone into other languages. Thus, for instance, only people that

learn the Bible in English get a feeling of the story line and the inner ideas

contained in the outer light. Another example is for instance the simple

meaning of the words “love your neighbor like yourself,” which has an impact in

English of actual love while in Hebrew the feeling of it is more like a slogan.

Fearing God or loving God are the same, for in Hebrew the connotation is more

like going to the minyan or not turning on a light on Shabbat, while in English

it means loving God.

·

Rabbi

Lutzato hints to the idea that Torah only has power when said forwards and

backwards. The Baal Hatanya explains the root in holiness of non-Hebrew letters

in

Torah Or

(and a hint to this is found in Rabbi Abulafia) and

therefore the same principle applies when learning whether in Hebrew or not.

·

The true

value of learning Torah is only when the intention is to serve God, not to

become a rabbi or use it make a living. When it is learned with the wrong

intention, it of necessity leads one to the wrong conclusions. Rabbis nowadays

can only be rabbis if they have learned the laws of how to kill animals and

taken tests to show that they know that subject well. Therefore, they have used

their Torah knowledge to get a piece of paper that would qualify them for a

position to make money. Therefore, they have learned at least some Torah for

the intent of making money. Therefore, in general it is forbidden to ask a

rabbi for guidance since that guidance will be incorrect. [This fact is hinted

to in the Talmud (Shabbat 139a), that all the troubles of the world come only

because of the judges of Israel)

So, the

entire Talmud is only the Talmud of the Nefesh [lowest level of the soul], not

the spirit or the soul

The

reason the Talmud is incomplete is that the souls of the Amoraim [rabbis of the

Talmud] were from Beauty of Emanation, from the time before

Zeir Anpin

was completed – i.e., the

Anshei Keneset Hagedola

were from knowledge of

Father coming down and the kabbalists of that period were from the same level

but going up… the

Tanaim

were from the six lower

sephirot

of

Zeir

Anpin

coming down and the

kabalists

among them were from the same

level but going up.

All the

above is on the level of Emanation but for the generality of the four worlds it

is thus;

the chapter I

deas in Science

], we have the diagonal such that we only

have the trace the things from the top left to the bottom right.

·

Every

level of Torah has a different inner light and meaning. Kabbalah is only the

inner meaning of Torah horizontally, not vertically. This is obvious from books

like the

Nefesh HaChayim

which says that the innerness of the words of

prayer is in the letters themselves not in the kabalistic intentions. Also, the

fact that the Torah says only a third verse can explain contradictions and not

any outside explanation means that the Torah is postulating an inner meaning to

itself in itself, not in the Oral law (since no outside explanations are

permitted). Soloke in number theory if it is consistent, it must be incomplete.

So, inside the Torah there must be a super-Torah. So, I postulate that the

system of Torah in the above diagram from the Rashash continues downwards [and

upwards.]

·

“To come

to the truth of science and Kabbalah is possible by prayer. One should

especially concentrate in the blessing Ahavah Raba before the Shema and in the

blessing ‘give knowledge’, in Shemone Esre.” -

from Reb Shemelke of Nickolsburg.

·

My theory

of learning is thus: When one gets up in the morning he is in a relaxed state

of mind. In my opinion this state is the only time any real learning can be

done. Talking with anyone or even saying ‘hello’ causes a break in the neuron connection

that causes any learning done after that to not be absorbed — for we see that

some things we learn and forget after some time. Yet other things stick inside

one permanently. Therefore, all real learning has to be done in the morning.

[The Baal

Shem Tov hinted to this, for he had a tradition from Achia HaShiloni that the

day one has anger in the morning he won't be able to learn anything after that.]

·

There are

many things in the

yidishkeit

[the practice of the Torah that

theoretically prescribe one way but in practice is otherwise. Sometimes, the

reason is that a person was created in a certain way such that the theory

doesn't apply to him. For instance; theoretically, I think it is clear from the

Zohar

that

Tikun Chatzot

is more important than v

esikin

.

However, I believe for many people the need for

Vesikin

outweighs that

of

Chatzot

because of their particular type of soul.

This may

apply also to living in Israel where clearly it it a great thing to all

opinions even to the Rambam; however, there are hidden things that cause it not

to be a

mitzva

.

In fact,

nothing in the Torah can you really know is a

mitzva

until you really

know what is going on in the hidden things. Just judging based on knowledge of

the halacha is worse than not knowing at all — for when one knows nothing then

he may follow his heart. If you ask then, why was the Torah given. The answer is

to teach us to go into our hearts to find God and give us the basic principles

that are really in our hearts and minds but from which we have become

estranged.

This is

the Rambam's opinion that all the commandments are really based on reason and

their force comes from the fact that they are already in our heart, not because

they are written. This applies to learning. For, in theory one should learn

slowly and review and not go further until he gets what he is learning now. But

in fact, in practice, it is better not to do it in that way. The reason is that

is the climbing way from the lower sepherah to the higher one step by step. But

since faith is connected to the crown, if one simply has faith and learns

simply, he comes to the highest knowledge, the knowledge that is higher than

knowledge the crown. This is signified by the way books are set up. For as one

reads from the top of the page to the bottom, he is going through the sephirot

that are containing in the inner logic of the book. Then as he returns, he has

effectively gone from crown to faith and back and this is absorbed into his

soul. [I think one should each day learn only the amount he has set for himself

to learn day by day, no more and no less].

·

Learning

doesn't make one spiritual. All the above mentioned spiritual levels are only

on the level of the spirit not the soul. Developing of one's spiritual self is

by prayer and meditation. One needs learning to provide the vessels to contain

the light of prayer and meditation, and one needs good deeds to contain the

light of learning. However, the drawing of the light is specifically by silent

thought. Action draws the

nefesh

; words of Torah draw the spirit, and

quiet thought draws the soul. This is something the Ari alluded to when he said

that unifications are higher than Torah [Saint Frances of Assisi also mentioned

this fact].

·

Rabbi

Nachman's way of learning is just to read the words out loud, and to do a

little bit every day of each book one needs to learn — and if you do it in

order and over the course of many years you will have completed at least once

all of the books of Science, Math, Kabbalah, Halacha, etc. And in the end, you

will understand much better than if you had labored over every point. But you

can only succeed in this if you have faith in Rabbi Nachman, since only by

faith will you have the stubbornness to continue this for many years before

seeing results.]

There is

a hint in the Torah that just by wanting to learn and understand one does merit

to it. For the work of the Tabernacle could be done only by the wise in heart

as it says several places in Exodus. And in Exodus 36:2 it says, “every person

wise in heart whom the Lord put wisdom in his heart, everyone whose heart

stirred him up to come close to the work to do it.” Thus, we see that God put

wisdom into the hearts of those who wanted to do the work.

Chapter 10 – Gemarah – The

Babylonian and Jerusalem

Talmud’s

·

There are

different ways to understand the Talmud. There is the looking-to-be strict way

and there is the looking-to-be lenient way. Both are valid (i.e., some people

learn to find ways of being stricter and some to be less strict — and both are

valid because as the Talmud says, “God said to do, so no matter how we do it,

it’s ok with Him.” — as long as one is trying to do the right thing.

·

I would

like to add that actually there are millions of valid ways to learn the Talmud.

To give some examples there is the going deeper and deeper into its infinite

logic, and there is doing the same with Rashi and Tosphot. But there is also

going into the length and breath as the commentaries tend to do. Then there is

the Kabbalistic way and the Halachic way. The halachic way is divided between

the Rambam who didn't assume all the Talmud has to have one parallel line of

thought and the other authorities who held that it did. (They held one place

can't disagree with another based on the “

stame de gemara

” — but the

Rambam didn't agree, because that is for the original compilation of Rav

Nachman Bar Issac, not the final version of Rav Ashi and Ravina who collected

all the pieces). There is also the way of Reb Chaim to find the deeper

principles. I had my own way for a while to find all the conflicting principles

in every subject and reduce them down to one final principle, but I never

finished it.

·

My model

of the Gemarah is not open from the outside (like the non-religious), but open

from the inside, — i.e., to go into the deeper dimensions. So instead of the

flat way, I want to open up the 4th dimension of the Talmud so that everything

it says should be invariant only if you look at it from the spiritual way, not

the flat way.

·

The Oral

Law was written down during the second Temple period in documents of the

Scribes (professional rabbis), the ultra-orthodox (the Prushim) and the

Essenes. After the destruction of the Temple, the long arduous process of

collecting, sorting out and arranging the discussions and decisions in the

countless documents and oral traditions before the Yeshivot in Babylon and

Israel began. The Talmud is a work of the genius of many generations after the

destruction, compiling and evaluating the laws handed down by those groups.

Therefore,

the Talmud itself doesn't present a question on Jesus since it was meant to

collect the traditions at the time of its writing and not as Divine knowledge.

It is a work of genius, but it is still influenced by the time period it was

created which was extremely isolationist in its point of view because of the

Bar Kochba incident. The purpose in the stories is, as all the history written

at that time, meant to instruct values and morals, not as historical facts.

·

The Oral

Law Torah existed as documents that the Pharisees, Scribes, and Essences had in

written form [as seen in the tractates of the scribes and in the Dead Sea

scrolls, which represent a body of writings from all the Jewish groups that

lived then including the Jews that believed in Jesus. However, those writings

have been suppressed by the Catholic Church since they contradict their ideas

which are based on Paul].

·

The

Rambam held openly that the only part of the Talmud that is actually a direct

tradition from Mount Sinai are the parts where the Gemarah says or assumes that

something is Biblical law. The Kabbalah says the Gemarah is from Royalty of

Emanation which means it came from a flow of wisdom from that sepherah like

Newton received a flow of wisdom from the realm of Math and Physics -- That

doesn't imply infallibility. History bears this out for we find many sources of

the Braitot are actually from the Essenes who had a totally different world

view from the Pharisees (the orthodox at time of the second Temple) and later

from the Talmud itself. The dead sea scrolls clearly bear out the fact that the

Gemarah is exactly what it claims to be, a compilation and evaluation of the

millions of Braitot floating around during the Second Temple period. Evaluating

the Talmud from the historical context it came in tends to take out its

mythical dimensions but if done with care and respect it shows its true

greatness.

·

There is

no question that you can take any statement of the Talmud or it's commentators

and argue it pro and con ad infinitum. The question is as to the fruitfulness

of this. The point is, no matter how far you go its only horizontal depth.

·

The

formulas of halacha result in an infinity of variations because of the slight

variations of the parameters of each person's individual soul and world-line.

When we don't know how to keep the commandments we are to go to the Jewish

Sages (Deuteronomy 17:8-13); and that is the Talmud, which is the generality of

the Oral law. However, the laws which they made to guard Biblical laws because

of a specific situation which existed at that time or place, those laws don't

apply in the opinion of the Rashbam and Raavad — when the reason for the law

disappears so does the law. To the Rosh even, if the reason applies, if it's

not in the same place where the law was originally made it doesn't apply. (See

the beginning of the halachot of non-Jewish wine in the Shach and Taz. See the

Rambam on putting ornaments on the streets of Jerusalem on the festival after

the destruction of the Temple. — and the Raavad there, and the Rosh at the

beginning of

Masechet Avoda Zarah

.) [The importance of not adding on any

restrictions is to keep the patterns of chaos of each person's soul which comes

from the circular sephirot and

provides

the energy

of serving God.]

Without

the ideas of the science of Chaos, it is hard to understand why the Torah

commands us not to add to the commandments.

·

The laws

of the written Torah are invariant. But the Jewish people are in an inertial

frame of reference as compared to Mount Sinai, so all explanations which are

direct traditions from Sinai always apply to them but not to non-Jews who are

in an accelerating frame revolving around the empty space. Different

formulations apply to them. Now even in the written Torah many laws are given

that apply only in Israel like a gas that obeys the gas laws when it is in a

state of equilibrium. When not in that state the only way to describe [until

now] is by statistical methods. That is why since the  the laws of the Torah

are statistically valid, but in cases keeping the law would invalidate its

purpose to Rabbi Shimon, the law doesn't apply. Perhaps Solomon’s mistake was

that there was a state of equilibrium in his days.

·

Many of

the laws of the Torah are based on probability, e.g., the majority of judges in

civil cases, and majority opinion in religious cases. It's OK if the Torah has

statistical laws because probability is part of the fabric of the spiritual and

physical universe. Before the case comes to court it's a wave pattern where all

the facts co-exist in mathematical wave form. But once it's in court the facts

are observed and reduced to particle form. [The majority of Rabbi Nachman's

advice is in fact statistical, not absolute. He simply describes the forces at

work in each mitzvah but the actual effects in each person's life will be based

on many factors. Like wearing

tzitzis

saving one from bad advice. It can

cause one to get bad advice also by getting involved with religious hypocrites.

However, Rabbi Nachman is referring to some degree of a spiritual effect that

the

tzitzis

do have.]

·

Not every

Kal Vechomer

(a conclusion from a minority) is a law to Moses on Mount

Sinai, but it is from heaven as is everything which comes from the 13 ways to

explain the Torah, (as the Rambam says in Moreh Nevuchim), for there are many

places in the Talmud where how to apply any one of the 13-principles is a

subject of debate (i.e. if you can prove a law from one of the 13 principles

then it is Biblical).

·

The

Gemarah in Sanhedrin (99a) says, “Even if one says the whole Torah is from

Heaven except for one verse that God didn't say rather Moses said it himself is

in the category of “he has despised the word of the Lord”, and even if he says

the whole Torah is from heaven except for some derivation or some a conclusion

a minority or some derivation from similar expressions is in the category of

“he has despised the Word of the Lord”. If this would mean every time a

derivation is said in the Gemarah that it was said to Moses at Mount Sinai then

all the Talmudic sages would be in that category, for the Talmud is full of

arguments on the application of the 13 principles. Rather this means that

anything proven by the 13 principles is from heaven, not that it's a tradition

from Moses on Mount Sinai. [On Biblical verses the Gemarah says God said them

to Moses, but on derivations it says they are from heaven.] (Also, the laws

brought back by the derivations, not the recollections of Yonasan Ben Kenaz

would have been rabbinical, not biblical.) Rashi is clear in

Brachot 5b

that the

mishna

was not given on Mount Sinai, rather that Israel should

learn the teachings of the law as they were handed down. This is clear in many

Rashis

and

Rambams

throughout Shas.

·

There was

disagreement between the

halachic

authorities and the kabbalists that

was very strong in the Middle Ages. This continues in every generation for the

rabbis continue to disagree with the cabalists of their generation while only

agreeing with the ones that have gone, like the war the rabbis made against

Rabbi Chayim Lutzato and against the Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Nachman and Rabbi

Abulafia. This was a continuation of the disagreements in philosophy between

the ultra-orthodox Pharisees and the esoteric Essences. The root of this starts

from Joseph (who was on the level of the inner truth) and his brothers. The

outer truth is the halacha.

The inner truth is the Kabbalah

. Only

afterwards the rabbis incorporated the Braitot of the Essences in the Mishna

and Talmud and accepted all the later Kabbalists while finding new ones to make

war on.

·

Every

mitzvah has a mathematical function determining how much Divine light it draws.

And that differs according to the parameters of the persons soul (vessel). So,

it is conceivable for a

mitzvah

to contain no light unless the basic

initial conditions are met, like having good character traits.

·

Torah is

only a reflection of the higher spiritual reality of Wisdom as the Zohar says,

“Torah is the fallen leaves of Wisdom.” Wisdom in turn is only a reflection of

the true spiritual reality of the Crown. And all this applies on each level of

the ten sephirot. For instance, the Spiritual reality of Formation is reflected

in the Mishna but the higher reality there is in the

Sefer Haichalot

(if

you have the right version of that book). The light there is even a higher

level but still isn't to be compared to the vessels of Creation, which is

Gemarah (which explains the great light that many feel when they learn

Gemarah…)

·

The idea

of tolerance is contained in the Torah in the way of a hint for there is an

argument about the application of many laws of the Torah in many different

situations. The traditional way of looking at this is deterministic, i.e., that

rabbis disagree about it until it is brought to the Sanhedrin for a vote to

decide the absolute truth. This implies the laws are deterministic but not the

application. It is possible that the idea of the Sanhedrin itself is

statistical and not deterministic since we find that the Torah itself says if

an individual knows that the Sanhedrin has made a mistake, he is not allowed to

follow it. Even though the aspect of the Torah of “forbidden, permitted,

unclean, clean, innocent, guilty” was given from the aspect of the Tree of

Knowledge of Good and Evil, it has an aspect of holiness that will be included

in holiness in the future. Perhaps from this we can derive tolerance as a

principle that exists in that No Man's Land between the opinions that permit

and those that forbid.

·

The sages

of the Talmud say that the evil inclination leaves the rest of the world and

rests only on Israel. Then it leaves Israel and rests only on the Torah

scholars. That is the imp of the perverse that doesn't care if something is

pleasurable or not. All that matters is that it should be against the Torah.

It's the evil angel that wrestled with Jacob that appeared to him as a Torah

sage because that particular evil angel knows the law very well and put

pleasure into things that would have no physical or emotional satisfaction

except for the fact that this imp knows it is forbidden

.

·

The oral

law is like a brick of gold that stretches from Moses until the center of the

empty space [vertically]. [Prayer is going back up]. The Oral Law as contained

in the Talmud is only one small horizontal slice. Since the Talmud stretches

vertically this would apply also to the written law or prophecy and Kabbalah

etc. Thus, we find a continuation after the Talmud of the light of the Talmud

in the

Geonim

and later authorities.

Chapter 11 – On Science

“Investigation

of the wisdom of the Creator that is seen from the creations is the closest

path to clarity of knowledge of His existence.” —

Chovot Halevavot

,

Section 2, Introduction

“Since

the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and

Divine nature -- have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been

made” — Romans 1:20.

This is

the line that prompted Michal Faraday to try to understand electricity, and

thus the connection between electricity and magnetism which is the source for

modern electricity was discovered. “Know that proportional to one's knowledge

of the Torah and the nature of the world, so the world is handed over to him

and subjugated under him.”

-Sefer HaMidot, Daat vol.2, Num 2.

·

In the

first four chapters of Mishnah Torah the Rambam gives a brief account of the

Kabbalah of the Torah and the science that was known in his days, and finishes

by saying, “The ideas of these last four chapters are what the first

authorities call the ‘Pardes’” Then in Chapter 1  (Laws of Torah Study,

Halachah 11-12), he writes “One must divide the time of his study, a third in

the written Torah, a third in the oral Torah and a third in understanding one

thing from another… which is called Gemarah… The things called the “Pardes”

(the fruit tree garden) is in the category of the Gemarah.” The Rambam thus

openly says that learning science is in the category of the commandment to

learn Torah and also on a higher level of Torah than the Talmud and legal authorities.

·

To the

Rambam in the Guide [III:51] the division of people is (from highest to

lowest):

a.

The prophets (the Crown).

b.

The philosophers (Wisdom) [of the schools of

Aristotle and Plato, not the rival schools of Greek thought of Epicurus or the several

other types that the Sages and the Rambam didn't go for].

c.

The scientists (Understanding) (Jewish or

not).

d.

Those who keep the commandments and know the

Talmud. (Knowledge-Glory with Royalty).

e.

Those who keep the commandments (Royalty).

f.

Those that don't keep the commandments.

The

Rambam does stipulate that all should be facing towards the King [the

Intellect-God]

-

otherwise they are evil.

Yet, this

depends also on why they are turning from the King; if for pleasure then they

are from the

Klipa

of

Noga

, if for sin they are from the three

totally evil

klippoth

(this corresponds with Aristotle's division of

people that

believe

the purpose of life is to have pleasure), then political

people [those that do right for the sake of the right not honor], and those

that love and live the contemplative life.

This also

corresponds with the three worlds.

1.

The pleasure seekers have root

-

souls from the physical universe.

2.

The political people [people keeping and

learning the laws of the Torah] from the world of Formation [on the level of

good and evil].

3.

Scientists and philosophers are from

Creation.

4.

The highest level of those attached to God

are from Emanation and included in Aristotle's contemplative category.

[The

religious divisions are horizontal and not vertical. Spiritual Judaism is on

the inside to the left [God's right], Legal Judaism is on the inside to the

right, Protestantism is just outside of Judaism on the left.

Catholicism

on the inside to the right. Islam is outside of both also

to the right and left etc.

However,

all this refers to the physical Jewish people or Christian people etc. But

since the Torah is given for every level and all time and all generations it

refers to the higher levels also. Thus, there is a spiritual Israel with souls

that are of Israel though their bodies are not, and

vice

versa

-

and this is on

the level of

Formation,

that is

,

political people or people involved with the separation of

good from evil in society in general.

So, it is

safe to assume that social minded people that are battling for the good of

society, not for

personal

honor are from the spiritual Israel of Formation. On the

next level up, those involved in contemplation of God and his works are from

the spiritual Israel of Creation

, p

eople

attached constantly to God are from the spiritual Israel of Emanation. But on

all these levels everything depends on

one's

intent so if one is involved in contemplation of God with some ulterior motive

he is not from the spiritual Israel, even though they are from Creation.

People

however do differ in their tendencies based on their DNA structure so there

definitely is an effect on people by being born Jewish, but it isn't the same

as when the actual soul is Jewish - which is independent of how one was born.]

·

It's

interesting to notice that the Rambam places philosophers and scientists on a

higher spiritual plane than people who know the whole Talmud and keep all the

commandments of the Torah. I however divide people according to their character

traits:

v

The Artist

v

The Scientist-Philosopher

v

The Religious Scholar

v

The Business Man (normally religious)

v

The Leach.

But in reality,

this is the same as the Rambam as Bertrand Russell explained. The Artist is the

Prophet. Each should have the same focal point -- the King. Those that face the

opposite direction have negative of their absolute value. If facing sideways

their value is (R)

<div class="feature-image" style="width: 80%; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <img src="../../../../images/" alt="Book Image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

(Cosine of the angle

between them and the King).

If they

oscillate, they give out a wave pattern. The waves sometimes constructively

interfere and sometimes not. But you can get an average value, which is the

reason democracies work decently if at least they are facing the King While

monarchies only work well if the monarch is facing the King. That's why the

Torah stipulates that the prophet has to choose the King or at least the

Sanhedrin, who should be hopefully somewhat intelligent and therefore should

make a halfway decent choice. (The main job of the Torah King was mainly

military, so his power was limited. But still it had a big effect on the people

who their king was).

In

conclusion, we can't divide people by religion because it is almost irrelevant

to their character, which to all the major religions is the main thing, and the

main path to God. Rather the main dividing line is the thinkers and the masses.

However, this has nothing to do with intelligence for an unintelligent person

can be a deep and profound thinker, while a brilliant mind can be shallow,

trivial, and of no concern to anyone (i.e., non-fruitful).

·

(I would

like to point out that this doesn't disagree with Rabbi Nachman whose tirade

against the “philosophers” of the Enlightenment of the 1700s has little to do

with philosophy. They assumed that by pure reason without revelation they could

construct a utopia. They were a new class of what we would call intellectuals,

or social critics and reformers. Rabbi Nachman was speaking about the group that

in his days was called specifically the “philosophers”. That point of view is

diametrically opposed to the view held generally in the 1800s of Romanticism

which believes that moral passion and emotion count more than reason. This is

closer to Rabbi Nachman’s point of view.

Rabbi

Nachman also disagreed with the Sages of Israel who wanted to combine Reason

and Revelation. I have gone with the latter point of view for several reasons.

One, I have tried to take Rabbi Nachman in context of all the sages of Israel

rather than the Breslover view which sees him alone.

Rabbi

Nachman himself talks about the importance of believing in all the wise, and

all the more so the wise of Israel, and all the more so the wise of the great

authorities of halachah of the Middle Ages upon which all decisions in halachah

must be based on.

·

“What is

the way to His love and fear? When a man contemplates the wondrous and great

deeds and creations of the Creator, and sees from them His infinite wisdom,

immediately he will love and praise Him and desire to know Him with tremendous

longing… And when he thinks about these things, he will become awestruck and

know that he is a small creature before He who is perfect in knowledge.

Therefore, I will explain important principles in the creations of the Creator

in order that these things should be a key to understand and to love God.”

-­ Mishna

Torah Laws of the Foundations of the Torah, Chapter 2, Halachah 2.

Then, the

Rambam explains principles of Kabbalah and science. He does not say that

learning the oral or written law brings love or fear. Rather science and

kabbalah. “The fullness of the whole world is His glory.” — Psalms 24

·

The Oral

Law places true scientific knowledge on a higher plane than Torah knowledge as

it says in

Mesechta Chagigah [Chapter 2]

and as it says about Rabbi

Yochanan Ben Zakai, that “He knew great and small things. What were the great

things? The works of Creation and the

Divine Chariot

. What were the

small things? The Talmudic discussions of Abbaye and Rava.” (This is the

Talmudic source of the Rambam, Mishna Torah Book 1, Chapter 4).

·

It is

interesting to note that the mother of all books of

musar

of Torah

literature,

the Duties of the Heart

puts science, the study of logic,

and ethics on a higher spiritual plane than Torah. It is even more shocking

than the Rambam, because it says this in so many words in his introduction: “I

have seen fit to conclude the introduction of this book with a story that will

make you zealous to understand its subjects and awaken you to know the

importance of this type of commandment [of the heart] above the other type

[physical]

and the importance of physical science and the science of ethics

and the science of logic above the wisdom of the Torah

.” This study in his

days was confined to Aristotle and Plato and their commentaries, and in

particular Averroes.

·

There was

after the incident of Bar Kokhba a tremendous change on the Jewish personality.

From nationalist dreams of an immediate savior of Israel and search for

philosophical and scientific knowledge they became a fearful isolated religion

and devoted all their energies toward the accumulation of the oral laws into

the two Talmud's. However, the Rambam and other sages in the later Middle Ages

realized that Science and philosophy were an integral part of the Torah. This

trend was followed by the Christian thinkers and mystics from that time and

during the Renaissance until the 1600's when there was the violent

anti-Reformation which began the divorce of faith and reason in the Christian

and followed by the Jewish world.

·

The Gra

and Rabbi Moshe Chayim Luttzato don't hold that science is a part of Torah. The

Gra however, says, “The degree that one lacks in any one of the seven wisdoms

will cause him to lack in knowledge of the Torah a hundred-fold” (referring to

the division of the natural sciences into seven groups by Aristotle) (Quoted in

the introduction to the translation of Euclid into Hebrew by Rabbi Baruch of Shklov

the disciple of the Gra). However, the Rambam holds that science is Torah, for

in the 1st two chapters of the Mishne Torah he writes basic ideas of philosophy

and kabbalah, and in the next two, he writes basic concepts of science

(astronomy, chemistry, etc.). Then he concludes and says, “The subjects I have

written about in these first four chapters are what the Sages call “the

Orchard”. Then in the laws of learning the Torah he says the things called

Orchard are considered learning Torah (on the highest level which he mentions

there.)

To answer

the contradiction to the Rambam I would say science is on the level of the

worlds above Emanation, that if you learn it to bring yourself to God, it’s a

part of Torah and included in the worlds of holiness. (See Lekutei Moharan Vol.

1, Chapt. 19, and Vol. 2, Chapt 78, and Chapt. 91, where Rabbi Nachman answers

this himself in basically the same way.)

·

The

knowledge of science which there

is today wasn't

known to the Gra or the Chasam Sofer who agreed with the Sefer HaBris which is

actually just the science that was known then. A lot of that science is

actually not correct. But still the Ramchal says that which is relevant to the

outer aspects of the physical world isn't Torah. Only that which relates to the

inner part of this world, or which relates to the inner or outer part of the

higher worlds is Torah. The reason may be that as you rise pyramidally, the

Torah includes whatever is in a time-like direction. The Rambam could answer

this however by saying that science is the explanation of the inner-laws by

which the physical universe works.

·

Rabbi

Nachman said to learn science in the Sefer Hamidos. The places where he says

not to are referring to the science of his day which was faulty. (The Rambam

makes this same distinction in reference to what the sages say not to learn

“outer wisdoms” which he said meant faulty wisdoms. (Many scientists then and

now tend to be hard-headed sceptics.) However, many of the great ones tend to

be spirituality oriented. For instance, Einstein, Kepler and Copernicus, who

was a church man, Feynman who at the end of his life became interested in the

New World ideas, John Grisham, the author of Omega Point, Oppenheimer (the Bhagavad

Gita), Neumann who was baptized into (of all things) the Catholic faith!, and

Paul Dirac who became interested in Jungian Psychology and the Kabbalah,

Socrates and the quiet voice that advised him -- as he mentioned before his

judges at his last trial. It seems these people got to the place where the mind

and the spiritual meet and tried to cross the bridge.]

·

The Gra

and the Chasam Sofer sided with “The Guide for the Perplexed” of the Rambam.

Rabbi Nachman actually quotes from it, though he railed against it, in the part

about the five differences between the intelligence of men and God.

Rabbi

Nachman's quotes from Socrates that “the highest knowledge is to know that one

does not know”. This statement is from the speech of Socrates who was told by

the oracle at Delphi that he is the wisest of all men. Then he went to all the

wise men and discovered that they knew nothing and thus he explained to the

oracle that he was the wisest, because he knew that he knew nothing. Don't look

for it in the

Guide

because it's not there.

Rabbi

Nachman's war wasn't against philosophy, but the so called propagandists of

France at that time known as the “philosophes”. And against subjugating

revelation to reason, but he agreed that you need both, as we see in the

Lekutai

Moharan

Vol 1 Chapt 1, Chapt 61 Vol 2, Chapt 91, and

Sefer Hamidot

,

Daat vol. 2 num. 2

·

The

struggle between reason and faith has had a long history in Judaism, Islam and

Christianity. The regular scientists and clergy always seem to be at odds while

the great geniuses of science and religion always point in the same direction

to the essential fact that there is no true conflict, and that revelation and

reason are both necessary and possible to achieve. This conflict and

oscillation between these two poles are what spurns growth. This oscillation

creates the spiritual waves that shape the existence of humankind.

·

The thing

about physics and Math is that at least they don't claim to make people better,

even though they in fact have a good effect, i.e., they don't make people

righteous, just a little better than what they would have been otherwise - at

least it trains one to think logically - and if this would translate into

action the world might just be a better place.

Bertrand

Russell said that there is a lot more virtue in intelligence than in virtue

(the top three sephirot - Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge, vs. the lower

seven - which are on the level of good and evil, permitted and forbidden, pure

and impure). This is like the Rambam, in that science is on a higher spiritual

level than Torah and

mitzvos

.

·

Abraham

Maslov said, “a soul not exposed to higher and beautiful things dries up and

dies.” The Yerushalmi says, “All are prone to sickness if they lack music.” The

Rambam says in the

Eight Chapters

that sometimes one needs to sit among

the “beautiful figures” to revive his soul. Beauty is the middle

sephirah

and

holds the node of the soul in place so the right and left sephirot can vibrate

in resonance with the energy waves coming from the higher sephirot.

·

The root

of Physics and Math is in the worlds which are above the world of Emanation,

and thus at the time of the breaking of the vessels they fell into the lower

worlds. But if one learns them with fear of God, they have the power to bring

one up to his higher root (This is the reason the sciences have been emphasized

by the non-Jews who are from the same world).

·

The idea

of learning science and math is to be attached to the thoughts of God in the

creation of this world. This is what the Sages of the Talmud call the

Work

of Creation.

The idea of learning Kabbalah is to be attached to the

thoughts of God in the creation of the higher spiritual worlds. So, one

fulfills the commandment of being attached to God by learning science, math,

and kabbalah. By learning Jewish law, one attaches his mind to the tree of

knowledge of good and evil which was forbidden to Adam, and by doing so he fell

from the world of

formation

into the world of

action

. However,

for us here one is required to know the law. Rabbi Chayim Vital writes “for

those who understand the Talmud very well they should learn it at the most two

hours a day and the rest of the day learn Kabbalah. [In the days of Rabbi

Chayim Vital there was no true science, so it wasn't mentioned by him.] But

people who don't understand the Talmud shouldn't learn it at all, rather they

should learn kabbalah all day.” The books of the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov

are a commentary on the kabbalah and show how it applies in daily life.

·

Rabbi

Chayim Vital is clear that the Talmud and authorities are on the level of The

Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was forbidden to Adam to eat from.

This is actually from the Zohar, but since the Zohar can be interpreted

differently, I have to bring this statement from Rabbi Chayim Vital. He says he

who understands them well should learn them at the most 2 hours a day in order

to break through the barriers and reach the core of good but everyone else

should just learn kabbalah all day. I believe science and math in their higher

root are higher than the world of emanation, and if one learns them with fear

of God are an essential part of kabbalah, i.e., kabbalah is from the name 45,

science from the name 63 and 52 and together can draw the light of the name 72.

·

To come

to the truth of Science and Kabbalah is by fear of God, but too much fear of

God isn't good as it says in proverbs, “Don't be righteous overly much.” For

instance, there is the personality of the 'artist', whose whole personality can

be ruined by fear of God if it isn't done in the right way with moderation. He

needs his evil inclination alive and well to function as a creator. (What I

mean by an artist is one who may be an artist in music or in science and kabbalah

also. Creativity knows no bounds.) But he needs not to do sin also. But the

scientist philosopher type isn't ruined by a lot of fear of God.

·

Even in

holiness there are services to God one is prevented from Heaven from doing.

Don't try to break the gates that God has made. Rabbi Nachman said not to be

stubborn about anything. When one path is closed to someone, I think that it

does no good to force down the door for its only result is to have that, and

other doors, closed.

·

Science

provides a garment for kabbalah so the klipos can't penetrate. Science tends to

take out of the fight between good and evil.

·

The

wisdom of the physical world has its’ root in the circular sephirot, so

learning it draws that light upon one which provides an outer light that

surrounds one and protects him. On the other hand, Kabbalah draws the inner

light.

·

Math and

Physics are the hidden light of the sealed statement of creation in which the

holiness of God is hidden. Nothing exists besides God, and everything is just

his Light in the vessels before our eyes, there is a great holiness in science

and mathematics. In fact, not just some holiness but the holiness of the hidden

Statement that caused the Creation, which is the highest holiness. But unless

it's connected with God it falls.

·

The sephirah

of Wisdom is the reality of the idea of Plato where the idea is the reality. Whereas

the lower sephirot are guided by those ideas. This explains how the Rambam can

equate philosophy with Kabbalah.

·

Every

book has its own given tempo just like music. It is important to read every

book at its given tempo and that takes precedence to understanding since if you

read it at the right tempo, you'll enjoy it and come back and learn it again

and again.

·

The

commandments are on the level of Royalty and so one word of learning Torah is

worth more than all the commandments together even if done with absolute

perfection. Yet Science is on the level of Understanding and thus one word of

science is worth more than all the words of Torah. Kabbalah is on the level of Wisdom

and prayer on the level of the Crown, and thus worth more than all others.

[This is true only in accord with the system of most of the later kabbalists,

not to the Reshash who puts the written Law on the level of action of

zeir

anpin

while the other kinds of learning in formation creation and emanation

of

nukbah

.(but that is only in the vertical system after the correction

anyway.)]

·

If we

would apply Rabbi Nachman's principle of just saying the words in order and to

have faith that eventually you will understand, to Mathematics, it would seem

to me that we would have a way that even the dullest student could become a

genius in Math. But if one does this because he thinks it makes sense, he will

cease to do it. But if one does it because he has faith in the saint who said

to do it, then he will continue and have success. However, I will say how it

works. Fear of God, and good and strong character traits provide the vessels

for the light. Then by being involved with it the light is drawn as an outer

light, that surrounds the person. By doing the exercises it enters into the

vessels.

·

There is

a principle called the love force. This force is a physical force that changes

reality. Therefore, the only real learning is by the love principle. For by

loving a subject you'll be able to break down the door in front of it. That's

one reason for Rabbi Nachman's idea of just saying the words in order and then

to go on without review. For if you love it that's all you need to get inside

the door.

·

My

impression is that whatever people do to make themselves more happy results in

their being more unhappy.

Chapter 12 - Decisions

The Greeks said know

yourself. Perhaps meaning, “Know your lacks and your good traits. Then you can

compensate. In place of lacks you can find friends that can do that part of

your life that you can't take care of. In the good traits you will know what to

concentrate upon.”

·

Trust in God and

simplicity. If you don't know something, then it is because Vesikin Vesikin God

doesn't want you to know. If He wants you to know, he knows how to let you

know. So, trust means do nothing until God shows you clearly His will. To trust

in God, you need to learn to live with doubt until God solves the problem. But

this is not automatic. Rather one needs actively to put oneself in God's

presence and then I believe that God will take care of him.

·

a.

Reconnaissance.

b.

Independent Confirmation, [from a source other than

yourself].

c.

Be Prepared.

d.

Verify yourself if it really is like you heard or think.

e.

Bible.

·

In America, people

pay a salary to what is called a personal coach or someone whose job it is to

get your life to be the best that it can be. This is what used to be a friend

[or rabbi], but nowadays with that gone one needs to pay a personal coach. If that

is a bit expensive a true friend is good to have. [So apparently the idea of

advice from a friend or mentor is not a totally negative concept as I write in

note {6}.

·

Situational

Awareness: This is something that fighter pilots need to stay alive. It is

being aware of the whole situation around oneself, not just what is in front of

us. This is the reason non-predators have their eyes on the side of their

heads. [Predators have eyes in front of their head like people]. In life

sometimes I am aware something is wrong in a certain place or situation, but I

can't put my finger on it. So, to some degree I have this awareness but in

general I have not acted on it, preferring to think everything is rosy and all

people are loving. Well, they are not and if you sense something is wrong, head

on out of there as fast as you can.

·

For Colonel Simons,

the great principle was reconnaissance -- [check it out before you go in]. This

was the difference between when he went in to rescue the hostages in Iran and

being successful, while in a different rescue attempt by the army, it was unsuccessful.

But in the

frum

world

you hear things like Rav Sonenfeld getting married on the first one offered to

him whether she would be proper or not. Maybe this was OK for him, but this

isn't the same thing as trusting in God. Trusting in God means you trust in

God, but you act to the best of your ability in each situation while knowing

that the final result is in any case only dependent upon God's will.

·

Is the “good” advice

of some rabbis a trap to lead one to be their slave and give up on their free

will? Or is it perhaps to lead one into an unproductive life? Why did all the

frum/orthodox stay in Europe during the period of the Holocaust? Wasn't it because

their rabbis who had generally given them good advice, advised them one time

unwisely, i.e., not to flee when the Nazis rose to power?!

From 1933 until 1939

why did almost no religious Jews flee from Poland? It is only because rabbis

gave them good advice at various times, so they assumed that this time also

would be so. Is what we call the Divine spirit of some rabbis a trap? [To lose

one's free will? Why is it that when faced with a life decision you don't know

which way to jump? Isn't it that slowly you have allowed the rabbis to take

over your consciousness and now I can't get it back?

·

So, life decisions I

think must be made thus:

a.

Never ask advice from people or rabbis. For once you have

heard it, it makes an effect even if you decide to reject it later - and every

time you ask you give up a little bit of your free will.

b.

Never make a life decision under pressure emotional or

sexual needs.

c.

Find a way to relax, like Winston Churchill who made most

major decisions of World War II while lying in a bathtub.

d.

Like Barbara [a friend] said, “Find out.” Do the work

necessary to find out the right course of action. Don't assume things.

·

But my question is

does this apply to a rabbi who has always seems to be right? Perhaps he really

is wise?

·

Israel of Koznitz

said a mitzvah that comes suddenly is usually from the evil side.

·

In all these

principles there are contradictions. So, I think the best thing is to make a

hierarchy of advice principles. The first being if you know you are not capable

of a correct decision then put it in God's hands.

·

The irony of it all

is that every attempt to bring Utopia to humankind seems to result in increased

chaos and suffering.

·

Why is it that the

experts always seem to know the least and to be lacking common sense? This is

not that people in general are all that much better. But the “experts” seem to

have a knack for getting on the wrong track. When I was young, I was convinced

that the reason for this was that experts are usually mediocre minds that have

done the work to get where they are. Then, in their position of power, their

inherent absence of talent manifests itself. This is probably correct.

But I must change

this idea. For my original idea was that all intelligence is one. This may be

true but nowadays I think talent tends to be very selective. Even Leonardo Da

Vinci had art and invention but no other fields. I used to say this was from

lack of time to go into everything. But now I think it simply may be talent is

selective. Of course, even after one has talent nothing can replace that spark

of inspiration one needs from God. For this reason, I believe fear of God is

important for creativity.

·

To answer questions

in life - no coin flips. No trying to get inspiration.

There is:

1.

First impression.

2.

Basic feeling.

3.

Doing the work to find out.

Not people's advice.

[There is enough in

his Godliness for every creation. Be satisfied with what godliness he gives

you.]

·

The is the problem of

listening to rabbis even though they may not be wise, perhaps puts one on the

wrong track - or just reinforces the already wrong track that one is on.

·

Learning to know who

to trust among people also is an important skill.

For money management

is a skill which is like any other skill. Some are good at it and others are

not. For those who are not it is important to at least tell who you can trust

in your monetary affairs.

Or in other personal

decisions, many times the nearest and dearest to us advise things based on

their own hatreds and prejudices without our own interest in mind. Someone

close to me was advised by people he trusted to leave me and found himself in a

whole lot of trouble for several years.

I myself trusted

rabbis more than my parents and have found myself years later striped of my

wife and children and no means of making an honest living except what I learnt

from my parents.

·

Leonardo De Vinci

thought people are meant to live balanced lives. It is true that each person

has a special area of talent, but each person should try to be balanced by

doing physical activity every day and learning different subjects. I think in

the way that God made us that we can only do so much of any one thing and then

we need to go on and the next day we can come back to it.

Thus, in values also.

Though on the surface it might seem there are different duties a person must

do, and they conflict, I think in fact there is no conflict for somehow only

one of the options is the right one and the task is to choose the right one.

Leonardo himself

developed different aspects of his personality in science and art and physical

activity. They say he was so strong that he could crush nuts in his hand.

·

Here is something to

bear in mind as you go through life from the author Herodotus: The exceeding

good fortune of Polycrates did not escape the notice of Amasis, who was much

disturbed thereat. When therefore his successes continued increasing, Amasis wrote

him the following letter, and sent it to Samos. “Amasis to Polycrates thus

sayeth: It is a pleasure to hear of a friend and ally prospering, but thy

exceeding prosperity does not cause me joy, forasmuch as I know that the gods

are envious. My wish for myself and for those whom I love is to be now

successful, and now to meet with a check; thus, passing through life amid

alternate good and ill, rather than with perpetual good fortune. For never yet

did I hear tell of anyone succeeding in all his undertakings, who did not meet

with calamity at last, and come to utter ruin. Now, therefore, give ear to my

words, and meet thy good luck in this way: bethink thee which of all thy

treasures thou valuest most and canst least bear to part with; take it,

whatsoever it be, and throw it away, so that it may be sure never to come any

more into the sight of man. Then, if thy good fortune be not thenceforth checkered

with ill, save thyself from harm by again doing as I have counselled.”

·

Equilibrium is a

major principle in life. What one does to improve his situation invariably

changes the balance. One can't foresee the consequences of that change. But if

the situation one is in is in any way livable, then to change it is probably a

mistake. Moving from one place to another changes a balance and should never be

done unless absolutely necessary. Also, in every person there is a balance of

talent. If smart in one thing invariably he will be foolish in another. The

most talented of people tend to lack simple common sense

·

I have become

convinced that most people tend to be the exact opposite of what they appear.

·

Without a college

education one is doomed to slavery. This is why the Jewish people when they

came to America instinctively worked like dogs to make sure their children

would get a college education. They had experienced enough slavery in Eastern

Europe to want out.

Now we have all

forgotten this and seek to be enslaved again to middle class boredom and

looking for some religious or political answer to the world’s problems. But

this is doomed to failure since every solution to one problem just brings

another and who is to say if the new problem won't be worse?

·

When going to the

Ukraine I asked a friend what to take with me. And they said, “Take as little

as possible [in order to open yourself up to new things Hashem may want for

you.” I then asked about the sleeping bag. She said, “You are going to the

Ukraine. You MUST take a sleeping bag." [I see now how wise that was. For

I thought I was going to a place that was heated. Then when I left and found

myself here in another place, I needed to wear several shirts, a sweater, a

jacket, then to go into the sleeping bag and then put two woolen blankets over

myself. All this is indoors. And this winter is mild. I remember winters when

one could literally not go outside for more than two minutes.]

My feeling is that

this relates to the motto of the Boy Scouts, “Be Prepared.” For to be prepared

for everything is impossible. And obviously I could not take everything I

needed.

But the idea is

first:

1.

Take as little as possible.

2.

In the extra space left take small things that don't take

up room but may come in handy.

·

I think there are

some people who give up too quickly and others who don't give up even when they

should. You should try to know yourself and see which type you are so that you

will know how to compensate. If you are the type who gives up on things too quickly

you will know the next time you want to give up that you should stick it out.

·

The lacks in our

character are precisely placed there so that we will refer all those areas to

God and come to him in prayer asking for help. For even though we need His help

in everything we do, those areas are made specially to remind us of our limitations

and to run to God for help.

“In

the course of regeneration, when man is being made spiritual, he is continually

engaged in combat, for before regeneration cupidities have the dominion,

because the whole man is composed of mere cupidities and the falsities thence

derived. During regeneration these cupidities and falsities cannot be

instantaneously abolished, for this would be to destroy the whole man, such

being the only life which he has acquired; and therefore evil spirits are

suffered to continue with him for a long time, that they may excite his

cupidities, and that these may thus be loosened, in innumerable ways, even to

such a degree that they can be inclined by the Lord to good, and the man be

thus reformed. In the time of combat, the evil spirits, who bear the utmost

hatred against all that is good and true, that is, against whatever is of love

and faith toward the Lord-which things alone are good and true, because they

have eternal life in them - leave the man nothing else for food but what is

compared to the vegetable and the green of the herb; nevertheless the Lord

gives him also a food which is compared to the herb bearing seed, and to the

tree in which is fruit, which are states of tranquility and peace, with their

joys and delights; and this food the Lord gives the man at intervals.” --

Swedenborg

“Unless

the Lord defended man every moment, yea, even the smallest part of every

moment, he would instantly perish, in consequence of the indescribably intense

and mortal hatred which prevails in the world of spirits against the things

relating to love and faith toward the Lord. The certainty of this fact I can

affirm, having been now for some years (notwithstanding my remaining in the

body) associated with spirits in the other life, even with the worst of them,

and I have sometimes been surrounded by thousands, to whom it was permitted to

spit forth their venom, and infest me by all possible methods, yet without

their being able to hurt a single hair of my head, so secure was I under the

Lord’s protection. From so many years' experience I have been thoroughly

instructed concerning the world of spirits and its nature, as well as

concerning the combat which those being regenerated must needs endure, in order

to attain the happiness of eternal life. But as no one can be so well

instructed in such subjects by a general description as to believe them with an

undoubting faith, the particulars will of the Lord’s Divine mercy be related in

the hi following pages.” -- Swedenborg

“In

time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm and constant in the

resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding such

desolation, or in the determination in which he was in the preceding

consolation. Because, as in consolation it is rather the good spirit who guides

and counsels us, so in desolation it is the bad, with whose counsels we cannot

take a course to decide rightly.” -- St. Ignatius of Loyola

Only when forced

In modern thought

spontaneity is considered good. In the meditations of Marcus Aurelius, we find

that one should not be careless. I figure that comes from the Stoic point of

view.

·

Sometimes one finds

himself attracted to a group of people considering them cool or with it in some

way. Chekov has a story about one such person that fell in such a way. I figure

this must be one of the tricks of the evil side to pull us away from our center

of equilibrium. (Showing us other lifestyles and making them look attractive to

us.

·

Don't do things

contrary to your destiny, for those things can take you away from your destiny.

·

Don't get

top

heavy. Learning every day is good in balance with

other things.

This applies to

civilization also.

There needs to be a

balance and equilibrium between the mind, heart and body. This is why Roman law

became the basis for western society. It was meant to be natural law: just

enough to provide for the need but not more.

This is the same

reason why the human brain works. It is just large enough to work. If it got

too big the balance would be thrown off and it would cease to work. This is the

reason Dinosaurs with larger brains never developed.

Since the head and

the heart are almost always in opposition, and heart is more in tune with the

Divine, if you know what your head is saying but don't know what your heart

says then do the opposite of the head. What makes sense -- don't do. The reason

is if the heart and head were together then you would know what your heart

says. Since you don't know there is therefore a conflict, and for sure your

heart says something else and therefore it is not what the head says — but your

head and logic are drowning out the message from your heart.

·

Sometimes the naive

among us hears a friend promise us some type of favor. “Come live in our house

and all your needs will be provided.” We know why people take care of all the

needs of chickens. It is not any altruistic ideal of benefiting the chicken. But

when we receive the same invitation, we can be fooled. Here is how Zeno reacted

to such a proposal. “And when Demochares, the son of Laches, embraced him once,

and said that he would tell Antigonus, or write to him of everything which he

wanted, as he always did everything for him, Zeno, when he had heard him say

this, avoided his company for the future.”

Learning is a Jewish

principle. The importance of this is because the essence of life is to create.

But how can one create something new if one doesn't take in and incorporate

within himself something new daily?

But not just

anything

new. The less one understands the better for as Swedenborg says, holiness

dwells only in ignorance… This means, one should learn, not to know, but to

fulfill he commandment of learning. Then, if knowledge does enter, it doesn't

hurt since it is all on the level of ignorance — because one is serving God and

attached to God to whom all knowledge is ignorance.

Also, the knowledge

one learns should not be man-made. It must be some explanation of how God's

creation works. Engineering is OK, so is politics. But not man made laws,

except if with the direction of discovering the “natural law”.

Artificial sciences

are called outer wisdoms by Rabbi Nachman and are harmful.

[]

Look at every

obstacle as an opportunity in a different direction, i.e., instead of opposing

the obstacle see if perhaps it is not just a subtle hint to do something

different. It is not always a virtue to oppose evil. You have to know what you

are up against.

See the attitude of

an Athenian general after Athens learnt a hard lesson from the disaster in

Sicily:

Accordingly,

they resolved to relieve it the next morning. Meanwhile Phrynichus, the

Athenian commander, had received precise intelligence of the fleet from Leros,

and when his colleagues expressed a wish to keep the sea and fight it out,

flatly refused either to stay himself or to let them or anyone else do so if he

could help it. Where they could hereafter contend, after full and undisturbed

preparation, with an exact knowledge of the number of the enemy’s fleet and of

the force which they could oppose to him, he would never allow the reproach of

disgrace to drive him into a risk that was unreasonable. It was no disgrace for

an Athenian fleet to retreat when it suited them: put it as they would, it

would be more disgraceful to be beaten, and to expose the city not only to

disgrace, but to the most serious danger. After its late misfortunes it could

hardly be justified in voluntarily taking the offensive even with the strongest

force, except in a case of absolute necessity: much less than without compulsion

could it rush upon peril of its own seeking. He told them to take up their

wounded as quickly as they could and the troops and stores w

hich they had brought with

them and leaving behind what they had taken from the enemy's country, in order

to lighten the ships, to sail off to Samos, and there concentrating all their

ships to attack as opportunity served. As he spoke so he acted; and thus, not

now more than afterwards, nor in this alone but in all that he had to do with,

did Phrynichus show himself a man of sense. In this way that very evening the

Athenians broke up from before Miletus, leaving their victory unfinished, and

the Argives, mortified at their disaster, promptly sailed off home from Samos.

The problems that

occupy our minds are never the things we should be thinking about. They are

like the world on the verge of the dark ages that was involved in trivial

theological disputes not seeing the abyss they were hanging over. What really

matters is to search God.

·

In my ideology,

kindness is the highest virtue. But when I go to help someone, it always wastes

time from other things that I do for myself, but incidentally help others also.

I don't know the meaning of this: perhaps it is obstacles from the evil side trying

to prevent me from being a good person. I am mystified by this so don't read

this thinking I have any answer. For I firmly believe in helping others. But

why is it that when I do it never works, and on the occasions that it works, it

turns out it really was not needed in the first place. Could this be a hint

that I should go about my own business and let God run the world?

·

If you see a person

making it their business to convince others that their religion is incorrect,

be assured that person is insane.

·

The more you hate

someone, the more you need not say anything negative about them - for

afterwards how will you ask them for forgiveness? For the sin of slander, one

loses his entire portion in the Future World. So, without that forgiveness, one

is in deep trouble.

This is besides the

fact that all one's good deeds go to the one slandered. So, despite the fact

that these motivations are selfish, it still is worthwhile not to lose your

eternity.

The most powerful

prayer you can say is to name those that have hurt you and release them from

guilt.

·

I am afraid of the

evil eye and try to avoid it. I am ultra-sensitive and hurt when people stare

at me or give me ugly glances. But I believe that this in itself is sometimes a

gift from God and a cause for blessing: but I don't treat every insult as a complement.

Rather I try to see if perhaps there may be some element of truth in what the

other person is saying. And despite the fact that they intend only to hurt me,

I don't look at the intention but at what in me needs correcting.

·

I have heard that

women are uniquely sensitive about their bodies. Because of this it is proper

that sex should be as wild as possible, to relax the woman. There is a

hierarchy of principles in the Torah. Kindness is the highest principle (to

Rabeynu Yerucham of the Mir Yeshiva in Poland). I think attachment to God is

the highest principle, but that kindness is the main way to come to that.

So, despite the fact

that the Shulchan Aruch advises much restraint in sex, I think this was not

meant in a case where the female needs to be encouraged to let go, in order

that she should come to a state of relaxation and a feeling of well-being. The

greatest kindness is to give to another person that which they need. Everyone

needs to feel good about themselves.

I think even bad

people need to feel good to repent. Bad people don’t repent usually just

because they don't feel good. However, Rabbi Nachman says differently. He says

at once when one decides to repent, it is a sin to be depressed, i.e., before

that one should be depressed in order to come to repentance. But this doesn't

mean what we call depression, rather it means a low spirit.

There is a problem

being accepted as a well-liked member of a community or a leader: this brings

down a person to the level of the people and tends to rid one of free will and

free thought. So, it is necessary to have friends that will criticize you.

Anyway, don't get semicha, and don't be a rabbi. The problems are pride, and

lack of free will, after one is accepted. Also, it was taken for granted, in

good yeshivot, that a rabbi never knew Torah - for if he really could learn why

did he feel it necessary to get

semicha

?

There was an American

hero that had a motto never to retreat from an enemy. I have noticed a similar

characteristic in Israelis. In fact, I heard of two fellows, one American and

the other an Israeli who somehow their wives had been complaining about them to

some rabbis. The first group called in the American on some pretext and corned

him with the divorce documents. He thought if he were a nice guy his wife would

return. He signed the documents and that was the end of him and his family.

The Israeli was called in on a similar pretext and faced with the same

situation. He walked up to the table and tore up the documents. He is still

happily married, and his children are all going to religious schools. [He

himself is totally secular which was the reason his wife wanted the divorce. He

is still totally secular.]

·

The worst enemy is

dissipation. I know there are lots of good things to do. If one doesn't watch

out, this enemy will get him. It is good for this reason to do your stuff in

the morning. Later in the day you need to relax. I think that as soon as one

wants to do something

good there

arises a

conspiracy, not to stop him but to waste his time.

·

The sages say when

one accepts the yoke of torah the other yokes of mundane things are taken from

him. I heard from David Bronson that he actually experienced this.

·

The problem with

doing everything perfectly is getting nothing right. It is the same with being

too smart. The sages tell us that the mother of Shmuel the prophet prayed that

her son would be of average intelligence.

I always noticed that

the really smart kids in high school just never seemed to see the simplest

common sense things, and this is in fact the reason why I have spent time

explaining a system of learning of just saying each page or paragraph twice and

going on. Because people I think are all very close in intelligence. Those who

excel probably just have better study habits.

·

I noticed my friend Barbara

never minded confronting evil head on. She would confront her own teachers if

she felt they were acting wrong. She told me instead of not saying anything to

warn someone from a bad group rather go into detail: for that person joined the

group for a reason.

All you can do is to

go into detail in order to help person be careful if and when the warning signs

do arrive. She went to

gehinom

to sing praises to God.

As for myself, I have

avoided evil. This is based a lot on the sages that say not to start up with

evil people. I admire Barbara’s approach, but she always suffered afterwards.

After she had been through some confrontation I would go to her apartment and

let me tell you — she was so wiped out she literally couldn't move to clean a

thing, this is a person who is usually clean to the n

th

degree.

·

The stoics held that there

is nothing between good and evil, virtue and sin. Either one is totally good or

totally evil.

This point of view is

helpful in considering whether to marry someone. Instead of the customary point

of view of looking at everyone as having some good and some bad, consider that

they are one or the other and try to decide.

This is in fact the

Torah point-of-view since to the Rambam, when one is mostly good the evil is

nullified. So, you really only end up with people that are totally one or the

other.

Now one problem in

the religious world is that objective good and evil get mixed up with ritual.

Religious people tend to judge virtue based on how one is in some rituals. But

on the other hand, the good thing about torah is that it teaches that there is

an objective good and evil. This, however, in recent years, has ceased to be so

— in that the religious now tend to believe in moral relativism but still hide

in religious looking clothing.

·

There is such a thing

as putting oneself in God's hands. It is not the same as doing nothing. Nor is

it seeking advice from dreams, angels, saints or even one's own intuition. It

is actively doing nothing until that very second that God makes one know.

·

The advice that

occurs to one when he has gone out into a field to ask God advice is many times

different than what he thinks to himself in his usual environment [even when he

prays in his normal environment]. The question is which of these to follow. It

seems to me that neither is wrong but that that which is received outdoors in seclusion

is better.

·

The subject of advice

which comes to one suddenly is subject to a debate between Rav Nachman and Rabbi

Yisrael of Koznitz. Rabbi Yisrael said, a mitzvah that comes suddenly is

usually from the evil side. Rabbi Nachman, in the story of the Simpleton, has

the simple one getting a message from heaven and immediately dropping everything

to follow it.

·

Avoid court-holders

[the type you find at every party]. Everyone gathers around them clinging to

their every word of “wisdom”. They are invariably those who know nothing — this

includes this includes rabbis.
