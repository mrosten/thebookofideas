            <p>The two types of prayer are speaking with God when the light flows horizontally from the circular sephirot and praying up to God when the light flows from the straight sephirot, vertically. This is why by the graves of the righteous it is usually easier to pray since the light is vertical, while away from there one can only talk with God horizontally unless by some merit, he can draw the vertical light upon himself. The reason one must pray very hard before he is answered is because the Zohar says God is hidden and revealed. Which means that there are quantum states of prayer. So just like in the atom if you put some small amount of energy into the electron, the atom acts as a whole and hides its inner workings. Only if you give it a lot of energy will the electron budge individually. Thus, it is with prayer. Sometimes to get an answer you need to put a lot of time and effort into your prayers.</p>
            <p>Many sages have offered a whole range of solutions to the problems of Yidishkeit ranging from learning books of ethics and fear of God [Musar], Chassidut, Kabbalah, Hisbodedut, extreme strictness in Halachah; some have offered different ways of combining these things by doing a little of each every day. I believe that all these things are merely tools. It's like climbing a mountain: some people are given one tool, and some are given all the tools. Some are placed on an easier side of the mountain and some on a tougher side. Not any one tool will work all the time for all the people or even one person. Everything depends on the individual alone, his desire to get to the top, his stamina, his perseverance, his intelligence, and understanding how to use the tools. And even with all that he can still stick the chisel in the wrong place! (Marry the wrong person and fall to his spiritual doom -- or divorcing the wrong person), so one need's just plain help from God.</p>
            <p>The proof that none of the above doctrines really work very well except for certain individuals is the adherents themselves of each doctrine. But the lack of basic human integrity on the part of the followers of each doctrine wouldn't be a disproof unless the Torah itself made integrity an fundamental part of saintliness, – as mentioned in the writings of Rabbi Sar Shalom Sharabi, the Chafetz Chayim, and the first authorities (I admit however that this logic is limited for only 1960's people cared about finding the right philosophy of life while most people just search a bit to find something which makes them content and then cease to think and get on with what they consider the more important business of money and sex and power). So even a correct principle will have only a limited effect.</p>
            <p>The real proof against all the doctrines is the fanatical adherents who according to their principles should have found some degree of perfection! Instead, we find people divided along the old lines of character traits which don't differ at all from religion to religion. The only effect of the religion seems to be on the people as a whole - to bring them to a slightly higher (or lower or just different) level than before and on the few individuals who use the tools rightly. What matters is fear of God, and each religion simply provides one way of expressing it if it already is inside of one. Even if each religion is wrong in the eyes of the other that doesn't matter as it says in the verse "in every place they are sacrificing to My Name – (Yechezkel), even though they are in fact serving idols, since in their minds that is what God wants, God accepts their offerings as if they were sacrificing to his name. As the Sages said along similar lines, "God said to do [the commandments]; however we to them is pleasant for Him."</p>
