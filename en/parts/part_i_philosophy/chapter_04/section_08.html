            <h3>Chapter 4: Piety — Section VIII</h3>

            <p>Fear of God is the key to wisdom, but many times the fear of God of the parents results in the wisdom of the children. Other times depending on its strength it causes the person that has it to be wise. University professors will in general have religious parents which resulted in their children being wise. Since Fear of God is such a key factor in wisdom and besides that we have Rabbi Nachman's way of learning, I would like to suggest a way of learning that would result in even a person of lesser intellect becoming wise: (a) Learn books of ethics and fear of God every day and keep what they say to do.</p>
            <p>(b) Learn the subjects you want to learn every day by just saying the words of the book in order from the beginning of the book until the end without skipping or repeats. When you finish the entire book, only then should you repeat the book again. [Sichot Haran 76]. This may take years, but I think over the course of much time one will see a greater blessing in his learning than if he had learned in the regularly accepted way. “Fear of God increases days” Stanislav Kasl of Yale and Ellen Idler of Rutgers, studied 2,812 people in New Haven. They discovered that outwardly religious people, whether Jewish, Protestant or Catholic, were less likely to become medically disabled, than those who didn't attend church or synagogue.</p>
            <p>A study of 454 men and 85 women in Jerusalem showed that secular [i.e., non-religious] Jews had a greater risk of heart disease than Orthodox Jews. Analysts from the University of Florida found that counties in the USA with the highest number of religious people have the lowest rates of cancer. Dr. Larson and his colleagues did a study on 400 men in Georgia, found that people that believed in God and attended religious services had the lowest readings of blood pressure. Those that had one or the other had higher levels. Those with neither had the highest readings. Dr. Larson and his team also reviewed more than 200 studies on religious commitment and mental health and found that religious people have lower rates of depression, alcoholism, suicide, and drug use than non-religious people. Young people who are religious also do better in school and are less likely to be sexually active. Married people that are religious reported greater marital happiness, more satisfaction with their sex lives and lower rates of divorce.</p>
            <p>The researchers examined specific concrete behavior like attending services, not just abstract belief. [From the book Age Erasers for Men by Doug Dollemore Rodale Books, Pennsylvania, 1994]. This certainly doesn't seem like Saint Frances of Assisi who held that you can't live a lifestyle of peace and own material possessions and still be called a Christian at all. However, I think fear of God has to be entered into with a willingness to do what is required regardless of the consequences — but the end result in general is that of peace and happiness. We find Haran burned even though Abraham was saved because Abraham was willing to be thrown in the furnace regardless of the consequences. Thus, he was saved. Haran was willing to be thrown in only because he thought he would be saved.</p>
