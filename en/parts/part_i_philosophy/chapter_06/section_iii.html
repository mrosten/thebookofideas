            <h3>Chapter 6: Reward And Punishment — Section III</h3>

            <h2>Chapter 6: Reward And Punishment</h2>
            <p>them for their good deeds in a temporary world. The reason is because if they are mainly sinful God gives them their main reward in the world which is the main and most important, i.e., the next world. Those that have a majority of good deeds God rewards them in the next world for their good deeds and punishes them here for their bad deeds. Thus, one who is mainly good will suffer unless he has no sin at all. Now this is certainly in accord with Genesis - but I would like to say that it also goes along with the rest of the Torah. For, the places in the Torah where it guarantees reward for good deeds is always in plural and referring to the Jewish people as a whole. So, it only is saying if the 51% of the people are good, then 51% will have good. They might be 49% of the bad and 2% of the good who will have good. At any rate in this world the evil people succeed and have money, children, and happiness. Yet, God gives good to the righteous eventually by preserving them, even if it is in a lowly way and by raising their horn [honor and happiness in the end.] If the majority of one's deeds are good, he is rewarded in the Gan Eden of Earth by the light of God shining upon him here and punished for his bad deeds in this life by bad events. If the majority of one's deeds are evil, he will be punished in hell and here on Earth have physical comfort. However, for good words one is rewarded in the lower Gan Eden and punished for his bad words in this world if the majority of his words are good in quantity and quality. If the majority are lies or evil talk, he is punished in hell and rewarded for his good words here. If the majority of his thoughts and feelings are good, then he is rewarded for them in the higher Gan Eden .</p>
