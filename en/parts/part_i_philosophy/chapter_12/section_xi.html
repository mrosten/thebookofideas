            <p>good yeshivot, that a rabbi never knew Torah - for if he really could learn why did he feel it necessary to get semicha ? There was an American hero that had a motto never to retreat from an enemy. I have noticed a similar characteristic in Israelis. In fact, I heard of two fellows, one American and the other an Israeli who somehow their wives had been complaining about them to some rabbis. The first group called in the American on some pretext and corned him with the divorce documents. He thought if he were a nice guy his wife would return. He signed the documents and that was the end of him and his family.</p>
            <p>The Israeli was called in on a similar pretext and faced with the same situation. He walked up to the table and tore up the documents. He is still happily married, and his children are all going to religious schools. [He himself is totally secular which was the reason his wife wanted the divorce. He is still totally secular.] The worst enemy is dissipation. I know there are lots of good things to do. If one doesn't watch out, this enemy will get him. It is good for this reason to do your stuff in the morning. Later in the day you need to relax. I think that as soon as one wants to do something good there arises a conspiracy, not to stop him but to waste his time.</p>
            <p>The sages say when one accepts the yoke of torah the other yokes of mundane things are taken from him. I heard from David Bronson that he actually experienced this. The problem with doing everything perfectly is getting nothing right. It is the same with being too smart. The sages tell us that the mother of Shmuel the prophet prayed that her son would be of average intelligence. I always noticed that the really smart kids in high school just never seemed to see the simplest common sense things, and this is in fact the reason why I have spent time explaining a system of learning of just saying each page or paragraph twice and going on. Because people I think are all very close in intelligence. Those who excel probably just have better study habits.</p>
            <p>I noticed my friend Barbara never minded confronting evil head on. She would confront her own teachers if she felt they were acting wrong. She told me instead of not saying anything to warn someone from a bad group rather go into detail: for that person joined the</p>
