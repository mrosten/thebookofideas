You should try to know yourself and see which type you are so that you will know how to compensate. If you are the type who gives up on things too quickly you will know the next time you want to give up that you should stick it out. The lacks in our character are precisely placed there so that we will refer all those areas to God and come to him in prayer asking for help. For even though we need His help in everything we do, those areas are made specially to remind us of our limitations and to run to God for help.</p>
            <p>“In the course of regeneration, when man is being made spiritual, he is continually engaged in combat, for before regeneration cupidities have the dominion, because the whole man is composed of mere cupidities and the falsities thence derived.

The certainty of this fact I can affirm, having been now for some years (notwithstanding my remaining in the body) associated with spirits in the other life, even with the worst of them, and I have sometimes been surrounded by thousands, to whom it was permitted to spit forth their venom, and infest me by all possible methods, yet without their being able to hurt a single hair of my head, so secure was I under the Lord’s protection.
