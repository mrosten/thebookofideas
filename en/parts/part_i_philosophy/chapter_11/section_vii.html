            <h3>Chapter 11: On Science — Section VII</h3>

            <p>Orchard are considered learning Torah (on the highest level which he mentions there.) To answer the contradiction to the Rambam I would say science is on the level of the worlds above Emanation, that if you learn it to bring yourself to God, it’s a part of Torah and included in the worlds of holiness. (See Lekutei Moharan Vol. 1, Chapt. 19, and Vol. 2, Chapt 78, and Chapt. 91, where Rabbi Nachman answers this himself in basically the same way.) The knowledge of science which there is today wasn't known to the Gra or the Chasam Sofer who agreed with the Sefer HaBris which is actually just the science that was known then. A lot of that science is actually not correct. But still the Ramchal says that which is relevant to the outer aspects of the physical world isn't Torah. Only that which relates to the inner part of this world, or which relates to the inner or outer part of the higher worlds is Torah. The reason may be that as you rise pyramidally, the Torah includes whatever is in a time-like direction. The Rambam could answer this however by saying that science is the explanation of the inner-laws by which the physical universe works.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Nachman said to learn science in the Sefer Hamidos. The places where he says not to are referring to the science of his day which was faulty. (The Rambam makes this same distinction in reference to what the sages say not to learn “outer wisdoms” which he said meant faulty wisdoms. (Many scientists then and now tend to be hard-headed sceptics.) However, many of the great ones tend to be spirituality oriented. For instance, Einstein, Kepler and Copernicus, who was a church man, Feynman who at the end of his life became interested in the New World ideas, John Grisham, the author of Omega Point, Oppenheimer (the Bhagavad Gita), Neumann who was baptized into (of all things) the Catholic faith!, and Paul Dirac who became interested in Jungian Psychology and the Kabbalah, Socrates and the quiet voice that advised him -- as he mentioned before his judges at his last trial. It seems these people got to the place where the mind and the spiritual meet and tried to cross the bridge.] The Gra and the Chasam Sofer sided with “The Guide for the Perplexed” of the Rambam.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Nachman actually quotes from it, though he railed against it, in the part about the five differences between the intelligence of men and God. Rabbi Nachman's quotes from Socrates that “the highest knowledge is to know that one does not know”. This statement is from the speech of Socrates who was told by the oracle at Delphi that he is the wisest of all men. Then he went to all the wise men and discovered that they knew nothing and thus he explained to the</p>
