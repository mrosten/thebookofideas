            <h3>Chapter 3: The Usa — Section V</h3>

            <p>Some of the other things which are odd about America is the attitude towards sex. Homosexuality is legal but wholesome sex between people already biologically ready and in need of it is not (i.e., teenagers). But, then again, there is no concept of wholesome sex in America. If a man has sex with many women, it's legal as long as they aren't his wives; killing life by contraceptives and abortion and masturbation is considered OK but creating life by sex between teenagers who are biologically ready and have much more intense feelings of love than adults, is not. Creating life by cloning is not. Creating more life by granting men the right to many wives is not. Biblical values would do this and the world quite a bit of good.</p>
            <p>The transfer of power in Russia from financial establishment to the intellectuals led to it being transferred to the military under communist rule. In America, the transfer of power from the political financial establishment to the intellectual led to the destruction of the American family. One reason would be that the intellectuals are usually from the wisdom of the evil-side, since they don't in general accept faith as their guide. Wisdom, if not connected with God falls into the evil- side . Also, another reason is that logic without the heart is a poor guide, and in those cases logic, not the heart was the guide.</p>
            <p>Another way of looking at this is that the sepherah of Royalty is the same as that for Faith {Malchut}, so Rulership is dependent on faith. Wisdom is good when it flows in Faith, but by itself it gives its flow to the wrong side. Psychology today is essentially a manifestation of peoples fear of freedom. Therapy is dependency on a magic helper — the therapist. The purpose of Psychology is to convince people that they need a therapist and then to use that need as a proof that they are accomplishing something. Psychology is the escape from responsibility.</p>
            <p>Super people are most creative yet the psycho-therapists and psycho-analysts destroy them by convincing them that there is something wrong with them and forcing them thus to conform. To a psycho-therapist, the worst sin is not fitting in, not being adjusted. With this as the working principle of our society of which we have given the pseudo-science of psychotherapy legal authority, we have destroyed all our potential geniuses. God forbid, if a social worker or a psycho-therapist had ever gotten their hands on a Beethoven or a Mozart — both with “abusive” fathers.</p>
            <p>The only reason they may have anything to show for their false science is the fact that</p>
