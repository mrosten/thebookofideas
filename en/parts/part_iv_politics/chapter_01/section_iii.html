            <h3>Chapter 1: Politics And The Torah — Section III</h3>

            <p>.) The actual amount of power given to the king is a debate in Mesechet Sanhedrin . In one opinion he has very little power and in another he is a real monarch. And the King is chosen by a prophet or the Sanhedrin. So, Democracy seems to have no root from the Torah. And this is amazing, since the Torah does deal with social and political and civil issues. So, in conclusion freedom within Biblical Law is an important principle of the Bible and the Oral Law -- not democracy. The Torah allows the Jewish people to choose any type of king or government it wants, in any way it wants. All that matters to the Torah is the fulfillment of the mitzvot; it really doesn't care what type of government there is. It is well borne out by history that every form of government has had periods in reigns of terror and periods in freedom. The government will never be better than the people of the country.</p>
            <p>I think the Torah ignores the question of the form of government because it felt that it is irrelevant. All that really matters is whether a particular group of people have a desire to be formed into a body-politic or a commonwealth. If they do, then whatever form of government, they chose is ok as long as the laws of the Torah are kept. Theoretically, this could be even a Democracy since the Rambam says the people of each town chose their representative to send to the Sanhedrin, and this could have been done by a vote while the act of ordination [semicha] could have been a final formality.</p>
            <p>The political laws of the Torah are statistical laws based on the normal distribution of a large number of people. So, the law of voluntary war is that non-Jewish nations will subject Israel or be subjected by Israel as is the case with all nations, there always has to be one that imposes its will on the others or there is chaos and constant war. It is interesting to note that the laws of the Bible deal mainly with Temple, the prohibition of idols, and civil law. According to the Bible, there are only relativity few religious things which one should do like Shabbat and tefilin .</p>
            <p>I know that's not the same thing as freedom of religion but it’s a lot different than religious intolerance in orthodox communities today or in history (light only flows within the vessels of the sephirot when it is unconstricted, not when it’s frozen in some frigid environment of fear, or when constricted into some unnatural form. The Torah gives certain boundary conditions, but besides that, “Thou shalt not add or subtract”.</p>
