            <h3>Chapter 1: Politics And The Torah — Section IX</h3>

            <p>rise of the modern state and capitalism has created two types of people: 1) the callous that has been born and bred to know that he has the face the world alone and has little sympathy for anyone especially in business;2) the fearful of this vast aloneness of the world and run into totalitarian systems to provide them with emotional and financial support. This is the cause of fascism and communism and the rise of the fundamentalist religions today orthodox Judaism, fundamentalist Islam and Fundamentalist Christianity and the Eastern cults. None of this has to do with an intellectual search for truth but for security in an insecure world. Thus, whatever truth may have been in any or all of these religions has been obliterated to make fundamentalist doctrines that would feed the need of the people. The world today is a lonely place.</p>
            <p>Friendships are for instrumentality. Love is another word for usefulness. My only answer in this book is to stick with your family and true friends people that you know have a true love for you. This is worth more than all theology and even true religion and faith put together. I don't think we should go back to the Middle Ages. This advice of mine is to provide true support in the world that is lonely and insecure, and bypass authoritarian systems that will fail. For in the long run Man won't give up his freedom and the all the cults like Fundamentalist Islam or Orthodox Judaism will rise and fall like fascism.</p>
            <p>[Freedom is a need of the human spirit, not a want] [Later I saw that Hegel also saw the impossibility of return to the feudal system.] [Since the redemption is the process of Understanding coming into the world the individual becomes freer, has more problems, and the political entity enlarges from city states, to a city that rules over an Empire [the Roman Empire]to feudal estates joined by an informal alliance making an informal state to the age of the formal state to the present age of informal globalization. Next, I suppose would come formal globalization.</p>
            <p>To assume that people act in a certain way irrelevant of the doctrine they follow is simply not true. The laws people believe in affect their character. Statistically speaking if you measure people's prejudice before you pass a law outlawing prejudice and then immediately after you pass the law you measure it again, the amount of prejudice is found to be reduced significantly. So, if the rabbis of the Talmud itself say all problems in the world come from the rabbis of each generation and we see the doctrine they follow is that of the Talmud itself, we know that something is missing in that doctrine that is needed to make people righteous. The reason is as the Ari says that the laws are given from the aspect of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, not from the aspect of the Tree of life which is the Kabbalah.</p>
            <p>The Orthodox who excelled in piety in Poland, Slovakia and Rumania were wiped out. In Rumania were the Jews of Transylvania who were ultra-orthodox, the Jews of Bukovina,</p>
