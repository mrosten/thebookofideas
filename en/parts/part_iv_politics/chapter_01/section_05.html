            <h3>Chapter 1: Politics And The Torah — Section V</h3>

            <p>Torah doesn't specify the way to pick and just leaves it up to the people themselves. And this is the smartest thing because it really doesn't make any difference. People get the type of government they deserve and the kind of life they deserve and the kind of spouse they deserve.) [The way the people decided who would be king is by the Sanhedrin or the prophet. Either way was acceptable.] Every utopia has failed. From “The City of God” of Saint Augustine and the “Utopia” of Thomas Moore and Plato's “Republic”. Zionism which assumed that since the Jews were financially successful in foreign lands, they would be all the more so in their even failed since Israel exists on the money of American Jews. Even the Democracy in the U.S.A. is becoming increasingly totalitarian in nature.</p>
            <p>The answer is the Baal Ha Tanyas idea which is really from the kabbalah, but the Baal Ha Tanya shows how to use it. We need chaos and order together, i.e., we need the light of chaos in the vessels of order, freedom in an ordered society and inter­connected world. This can only be with Jews who have the power of combining opposites. Yet freedom must exist because every person has his own higher roots that they must adhere to but only within the vessels of order. The only system that has a chance of working is an integrated system.</p>
            <p>The Torah system could have worked by itself (for the Jewish people) until many of its secrets fell into scattered places. Even the written law was only given on the physical level and is the garment of the inner-Torah. And the laws of the Torah are the body of the Torah. But only the Soul of the Torah is the real Torah. So even though the written law is perfect, the deeper philosophical political and esoteric, and scientific ways of understanding of it have been forgotten and lost (as the Rambam has already stated in reference to the philosophical and scientific secrets of the Torah).</p>
            <p>The underlying principle of the Torah is kindness and justice. There always has to be one country imposing its polices on everyone else for there not to be chaos. The idea of the Torah was to have that country be Israel in order that the polices should be civilized. If in fact the state of Israel would be in the place of America today, its polices would in fact be even more tolerant and civilized than America. So, gentiles believing in the Bible come into the category of “Thou shalt love thy neighbor like thyself”— the sages say that this means “people that are with you in Torah and commandments”. Many Sages said that the gentiles become a part of the body of the Jewish people by their acceptance of the Bible [i.e., Christianity and Islam]. This may seem forced, but without this idea, the Torah, Talmud and Shulchan Aruch are definitely fascist. [However, if Islam today wouldn't be a sworn enemy of the Jewish people, it would revert back to being a branch of the Judaism and it would be a commandment to love Muslims.] The</p>
