            <h3>Chapter 2: Marriage — Section VI</h3>

            <p>The genius of the species wants improvement of the species so promiscuous sex is not good because it is aimed at quantity, not quality. Marriage is possibly good since the mates check out each other beforehand to see if they are compatible which is in fact irrelevant but what does matter is that they convey the information true the genius of the species which knows if the female male aspects complement each other. If so, they get sexually aroused. None of this has anything to do with compatibility or character.</p>
            <p>The reason for infatuation is that the genius of the species [y echida ] sees that the male and female aspect of these two individuals complement and complete each other so the children may turn out better than either. However, there is no guarantee that this will be the case since it still depends on God's will. Promiscuous sex is evil since there is no possibility of improving the species since there is no discretion as to whether the male and female aspects complement each other. Lack of infatuation means a knowledge of the genius of the species that the children resulting from the union will not be good. This is why the Jewish Orthodox community deteriorates every generation. Even though there are no more arranged marriages, but they also aren't based on love or infatuation. Therefore, one must be very careful to marry only a person he or she is infatuated with. Even if it only a temporary feeling it doesn't matter, for at least at the beginning it has to be there.</p>
            <p>Marriages based on infatuation alone are not usually the stable ones and thus are not in the best interest of the individuals involved, but the genius of the species is looking for the good of the children. That is why they are attracted to each other. Hopefully it should be possible to have marriages based on infatuation that the more mature members of the family and friends also approve of so there should be hope of stability also. Keeping one's area clean is important. However, there are several things to know about cleanliness: 1) Just because you are cleaning doesn't mean you have to yell at everybody else to clean. If you want to be clean, very nice, but don't make everyone miserable because of it.</p>
            <p>2) The reason TV was created was so that you can clean your room while you are watching it. 3) The reason you can't teach a teenager cleanliness is that it has to come from inside, the teenager has to become disgusted enough himself from living in filth to clean up. At any rate it is a very important rule in parenting not to rule, not to take the rulership from God. God alone is the Ruler and when one tries to rule others [or himself by imposing arbitrary rules] one is infringing on God's rulership.</p>
