            <p>completely different paths. One was into prayer, another into good deeds, another into learning and so on. Jesus contains the vessels of Tohu [chaos] and thus majors in physical healing, and in bringing people to the Garden of Eden in the next world; which is also so to speak relevant to the vessels of the light, which are people's souls, and the actual surroundings of those souls in the next world. Rabbi Nachman has to do with more with the drawing of the infinite light of the crown, or of wisdom its vessel. He has very little to do with healing anybody or miracles in general.</p>
            <p>We are indebted to the Hindu thinkers [Shankara and Ramanuja] for the emphasis and clarity of their belief that the God is the only reality. This belief eventually got into Judaism, where it was all the time (but submerged), until the Baal Shem Tov brought it to the surface and the Litvaks were forced to concede to its truth - however reluctantly that may have been. Yet the pessimism of Hindu and Buddhist teachings (i.e., their idea that human deeds are fruitless and have no essential value) stifled their civilization for 2000 years while the Jewish belief in the power of the mind [the father] and the Christian belief in the power of good deeds [the mother church] shaped and brought forth western civilization. Here we have another example of the importance of Reb Zushia's idea of combining the paths of all the saints How to Tell if Someone is a Saint Rabbi Yakov Abuchatzeira writes in Maaglei Zedek, that if you see two people serving God, but one if full of miracles and the other is not, you should know the reason is because the one with the miracles is a greater saint than the other even though you don't know why. As Eliyahu the Prophet said, “if I am a man of God let fire come down from heaven.” He made the test of his righteousness dependent on a miracle. This test would leave all present-day rabbis out in the cold.</p>
            <p>The reason some psychic people or even saints lack certain knowledge is that part of their soul is missing. Some saint/psychics can advise on everything until it comes to a monetary issue, where their love for it blinds them. Also, in a more general way this explains why only one Jewish saint saw the truth about Jesus even though there were many other saints before and after him. This also explains how Rabbi Akiva could decide that Bar Kochba was the Messiah - the Messiah frequency was missing in his radio.</p>
            <p>It was revealed to the Baal Shem Tov that he came to his high level not so much from</p>
