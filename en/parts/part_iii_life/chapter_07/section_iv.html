            <h3>Chapter 7: Saints — Section IV</h3>

            <p>The Rambam writes that making anything a mediator between you and God is idolatry (just the same as serving anything besides God. So, apparently there should be a problem doing any mitzvah which is supposed to bring you close to God and bring blessing from God. Now, the idea that a mediator is against the Torah isn't accepted by all authorities. So, to them there is no problem with the Gemarah saying that when you have someone sick at home you should go to the Torah scholar to pray for you; nor with the Gemarah about the saint who was having trouble with his neighbors and went to the grave of his father asking for help; nor with the Gemarah saying that if people would be able to go to the grave of Moses to pray, the redemption would come right away.</p>
            <p>But if we go with the Rambam we would have to say that mitzvot and tzadikim are included in the 10 sephirot of Emanation and thus are considered one with God. I would say the Rambam avoided all this by saying “making a creation a mediator”. Also, when you do the mitzvot, those are the things God said to do to come close to Him and receive his blessing, so they are serving God, and in a way the mediators that God has specified for his service. This would include being “attached and united” to a Tzadik which is one of the 613 commandments.</p>
            <p>The difference between the Rambam and the other authorities is that if one holds that a Tzadik is a sephirah of Emanation then to the Rambam it would be forbidden to ask him to pray for you, but if you hold like the other authorities, it would be permitted. The idea of combining the paths of the righteous is from Zushia the brother of the Rabbi Elimelech of Lezinsk. He, however only used the idea for the chasidishe saints... I have gone out on a limb to take it further to combine all saints. If this is correct it is a tremendous truth. If not, I will be dammed forever by the view point of any religion. [Reb Zushia got it from the verse, “for God knows the path of the saints”, “knows” has a double meaning, of putting together. So, Reb Zushia derived the idea that God puts together the diverging paths of the saints. This was in relation to the Chasidishe saints who all had</p>
