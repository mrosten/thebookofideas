            <h3>Chapter 3: Sex — Section III</h3>

            <p>points out often )? The problem with that is that there are other gods besides Him, so to speak, but they aren't gods but angels appointed over their specific tasks. So, when it says there is nothing besides Him, it has to be taken literally, that none of the things God created have any existence without Him. In a practical vein the actual existence of matter is the condensed light of God. It is not from the empty space but from the light that was drawn into Akudim, the light returned up and the vessels stayed behind and thus became solidified.</p>
            <p>Because of the breaking of the vessels later on, the matter we see doesn't appear to contain any of that light, as it would have — if not for the breaking of the vessels. But in any case, the actual substance is from the light, not from the empty space. I have thought however that in some way there is a relation to the empty space, but it is probably not true. The real probable cause of the solidification is the very reason why there was a creation in the first place, i.e., the basic “lack” that was in the kindness of God before there was anyone to do kindness to.</p>
            <p>So, He had to create separate beings from Himself in order to reward them with the highest good, i.e., being one with Him. So, when you look at the world around you it is accurate to conceive of it as the condensed light of God. To actually receive the revelation of the light however is in the next world. This world is only a preparation. So even the light that shines here is just to purify us for that great light there. Meditation doesn't draw it. It merely helps one go into oneself to discover who he is. There is no mental energy. All the metaphors in this book are talking on higher spiritual levels, not the physical world.</p>
            <p>The Life force exists on one level, and the spirit on another, and the soul on another etc... These levels are related only by the Strange Loops or some hidden staircase from level to level. They are not accessible by any trick. God hates tricks and He will never shine his light on anyone that thinks he can get it by some trick, practice, or good deed, etc. God's light is a gift that may come once in a lifetime or stay awhile but it can never be forced. What meditation can do is to bring one into his own vessels, and to clean them out and polish them but it can't draw the light. If God wants to pour in the water after you cleaned your vessel that is up to Him. Even the mitzvot of the Torah are to make us holy and to love and fear God, but they can't draw God. As He said, “I will have mercy on him who I will have mercy upon.” — The Strange Loop again.</p>
