            <h3>Chapter 1: Jesus Christ — Section XVII</h3>

            <p>the corpses of the Kittim”. Here is mentioned the fact that there were a few verses of Isaiah that we don't have in the present day Isaiah. These verses clearly speak about a messiah that will be killed by the ruler of the people and sanctioned by the high priest and armies of the Kittim, i.e. the Romans, according to the Targum Unkelos. This explains references that Jesus and Paul made to verses predicting his death that we don't have in our present day Bible. A further objection I have heard is against the virgin birth. Christians usually bring a proof to the virgin birth from Isaiah 7:14. Jewish people arguing against them point out that the word “ almah ” doesn't mean a virgin but a young girl.</p>
            <p>However, the   Jewish commentary, the Even Ezra explains, “It is probable that it means virgin or a girl who has had sex,” i.e., either one is equally likely. [Besides that, one could always answer from the verse in Genesis that the Sons of God came in unto the daughters of man and they gave birth.] One important proof of Jesus is very simple. If physics would teach people to be good and those that learned it would be not good then we would have a question about its validity. But now that it teaches about physical reactions and those reactions occur as it predicts, then we have no question. Now, since the Talmud teaches people to be good and the people that learn it are not good, we have a question about its validity. To throw it out is not possible since the Bible itself says that the rabbis alone have the authority to interpret it. Thus, we have to figure out what is wrong with the Talmud.</p>
            <p>Many solutions have been offered. As we see in Israel, none work. Based on every solution that is offered there is a yeshiva/s built on that principle. None of the results of those solutions come out particularly better or worse than anyone else. Jesus is left as the only viable option who has had success for 2000 years of inspiring countless hospitals, orphanages etc, and taming violent civilizations and people. To a degree,  it is possible to accept the idea of the Trinity [since it is the job of every person to be one with God and we assume a true saint has succeeded in that job].</p>
            <p>Thus, Christ was the infinite God coming into finite limits in order that finite man could have some concept of God. This is the reason for the manifestation of God in all the places in the bible [like the Temple, or at Mount Sinai, or by an angel], where he limits himself in time and space. This is to give the human mind the ability to expand. The human nefesh [life force] can receive the light of God on the level of faith [alpha 0, the first type of infinity]. The spirit can receive the light of beauty [alpha 1, the second infinity]. Jesus was to allow the second infinity to permeate the consciousness of Man. Rabbi Nachman is for the soul to receive the light of the next type of infinity, Understanding.</p>
