            <h3>Chapter 6: Israel — Section III</h3>

            <p>there can never be peace until the Muslims give up the Koran. [Shavuot 16a] Rabbi Eliezer held the first Holiness was only as long as the Jewish people stayed there. This is the halacha to all authorities. Rav Huna held that the holiness of the land of Israel needs to be established by a King and the Urim and Tumim. The halacha is like Rav Huna to all the authorities. Tosphot puts these two together and comes up with the idea that teruma and maaser nowadays is only rabbinical, not biblical. This means in plain english that to this opinion the holiness of the land of Israel nowadays is only rabbinical, not biblical. Thus, even if we concede to the Ramban that there is a biblical mitzvah of living in Israel [which the Rambam doesn't hold with anyway] still who says you can fulfill it nowadays by living in Israel. Biblically speaking Israel isn't holy, only rabbinically, at least according to this last way of thinking... However, there are opinions that it is Biblically holy also None of these reasons would be sufficient to cause one not to live in Israel except that Jesus said when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies get up and leave.</p>
            <p>This advice saved the original Jewish church in Jerusalem for at first the Roman armies came and surrounded Jerusalem and then the general was called back to Rome. At that point the church remembering Jesus' words got up and left for Pele in Jordan. Then the Roman armies returned and destroyed Jerusalem. Even though Jesus said this then it seems to me that the same advice would apply today. [The idea of Jesus was that Israel doesn't have the light of political stability. That light seems to be particular to America].</p>
            <p>Certain ideas don't resonate with certain groups of people. This is the reason for the failure of American foreign policy throughout the world. Things like freedom of the press or democracy simply don't resonate with Arabs. However, statements like “Death to the Jews” or ideas of Arab hegemony over the entire region do. It makes a great deal of sense to me that Israel has to deal with Arab uprisings the same way Arab countries do within their own borders. It is true that with Arabs in countries like America ideas like freedom do resonate more because they are becoming americanized, but in the Middle East the idea of freedom has no emotional weight or moment of inertia. It can come and go as easily as the breeze. Even though the land of Israel was promised to the Jewish people God never receded his blessing to give it to Ishmael also who was born after God promised to give it to Abraham's children. This is especially obvious in the Targum where it says “children” in the plural. God only said that he would take it from the Canaanites. And the blessing that Ishmael was included in referred to the land from the Nile to the Euphrates. Which in fact is occupied by the dependents of Ishmael. The later promises to the children of Israel in the desert specified very definite boundaries quite limited to the present region. And further it is even more interesting that the two present tribes that the Je wish people consist of (Judah and Benjamin) are the most populated areas of Israel (Jerusalem and the surrounding area).</p>
