You receive spiritual flow only to the degree that you give it. In the final correction, the children often exceed the parents, representing a higher step in the ladder of refinement. Rules vs. Love Rules without love are dead; love that occasionally breaks a rule is life-giving. Children respond not to your words or deeds, but to the underlying feelings . Handing a child to a guardian who lacks genuine love is, in a spiritual sense, an act of extreme harm. Raising the Teenager Teenagers are not \"miniature adults\" in waiting; they are adults who simply look small. The key to raising them is Respect over Love. If they feel their feelings are dismissed as \"meaningless\" by a \"big shot\" parent, they will eventually find meaning elsewhere—often in destructive cults or movements that provide the parent-figure they lack. The Game Theory of Authority Applying Game Theory to parenting means accepting that total control is an illusion.

The Inert & The Volatile A family of seven children often takes on the stable, inert character of Nitrogen (N₂) . It is robust and self-contained. However, this stability requires a \"hermetic seal\" against volatile elements. It must avoid bonding with \"Nitroglycerine-people\"—souls that are highly reactive and unstable. When a stable Nitrogen family bonds with a reactive agent, the result is not a stronger molecule, but TNT (Trinitrotoluene). ⚠️ Parental Warning: To maintain stability, you must be the primary source of philosophy/Torah for your children. If you do not fill their minds with your \"Inert Truth,\" the world will fill it with \"Volatile Lies.\" II. The Axiom of Respect Children need your respect more than your love. Treat their words as axioms. When a teenager speaks, assume it means something fundamental. If you dismiss their feelings as \"childish\" because you are a \"big shot\" parent, you essentially declare yourself irrelevant to their internal world.

Respect your children. They are the same people they will be when they are adults. If you are angry with your children, this is a sure sign that judgements are dwelling on you. Assume you are wrong. Rabbi Nachman gave said some advice which I think is particularly appropriate for raising children. One of his major principles was, “Not to be stubborn about anything in the world”, which in Hebrew has a little different connotation than in English. It means not to force any issue with children. Also, he said not to slug them. Which in modern day Breslov is interpreted to mean not to hit them at all but I can't imagine that Rabbi Nachman really meant that. However, it probably is a good idea to not hit at all. For Children For children let me warn you the worst thing you could ever do to yourselves is to cause your parents pain (emotionally). It's worth it to give up a lot to keep your parents happy - even bad parents. I understand there can be exceptions, but this is a general rule. One who stands alone without his family will probably fall into some trap the religious and political fanatics of the world like to set for people. This is an important principle in life. (Sometimes a parent can be lacking all parental feelings, and thus be unfit to advise his children, but in the natural scheme, one's best friend will always be one's parents.)

This is rooted in the belief that the Sepherah of Foundation correspond to the teenage years.

Of these, Love is the highest of the seven lower Sephirot (forces), yet it remains a \"vessel\" for the higher intellectual fields. It is the only force capable of bridging the gap between the physical and the spiritual worlds. True love requires the readiness for self-sacrifice—the willingness to give up one's life for another. The Commitment of Foundation The stability of a marriage depends on the degree of commitment. If one partner is fully committed but the other is only \"committed to the perks\" of the relationship, the structure will eventually collapse. Commitment provides a protective Makif (Outer Light) that wards off the challenges of time and familiarity. Divine Presence and the Klipot When the Divine Presence (Shekhinah) falls into the Klipot (Shadows), marriage can become a source of profound judgment. Many women end up marrying a \"shell\" of a man, bringing more shadows into the world unless they can free themselves through spiritual elevation.

At the time of the revival of the dead they and all those who are supposed to be together will be together - but that can only be accomplished by the readiness to give up one's life for each other in this world. But understanding is also on the level of self-sacrifice which shine upon those that love each other; and that merit isn't just for them but for the correction of the whole world - to create a better world at the time of the revival of the dead so that all loved ones will be able to be together forever in God's light in the physical and spiritual world which will all be one at that time, in the world that will be above time and space. A deeper way to understand marriage would be to apply it to the two sephirot of Beauty and Royalty. But the Divine Presence has fallen into the klipot, so many women end up marrying some klipah and bringing more klipot into the world unless she can free herself from the evil side.

However, the basic types are: 1. The spiritual marriage: This marriage is the revelation of an already existing bond. This one can weather all obstacles, since its essence is eternal. But it requires that both mates be homo-spiritualis — spiritual beings. 2. The fun marriage: This is the marriage of the scientist philosopher whose motivating principle is curiosity and creativity. 3. The reasonable marriage: Not bad if based on feeling also, but reason is a very poor basis for human relationships. 4. The community sponsored marriage, or the practical. i.e., those that wouldn't be together except for the honor one or the other has from the community and the community support. These are put together and kept together by the community. There is nothing holy about this. It is purely biological. Marriage of the Jewish orthodox are of this type. [In each of these four types, for the marriage to be stable they both have to be of the same type of person. But as you can see a stable marriage doesn't mean there is anything good about either person.] There is such a thing as finding the right person and knowing that it is so.

If so, they get sexually aroused. None of this has anything to do with compatibility or character. The reason for infatuation is that the genius of the species [y echida ] sees that the male and female aspect of these two individuals complement and complete each other so the children may turn out better than either. However, there is no guarantee that this will be the case since it still depends on God's will. Promiscuous sex is evil since there is no possibility of improving the species since there is no discretion as to whether the male and female aspects complement each other. Lack of infatuation means a knowledge of the genius of the species that the children resulting from the union will not be good.

It reacts against the individual like a jealous force, exacting a price in spiritual depletion and internal dissonance. But when the vessel is whole, the act becomes a mechanism of higher unification, drawing the Or Makif (Surrounding Light) into the very bodies of the lovers. Sanctified (Ascent) Sensual (Gravity) The Ascent of the Spark When the intent is connection, the act functions as a Korban (Sacrifice) in the Temple.

These levels are not connected by a simple ladder, but by Strange Loops —hidden staircases that allow for the transition between dimensions. These transitions are not accessible by \"tricks\" or specific practices. God hates shortcuts; the Divine Light is a gift that may come once in a lifetime or stay for a season, but it can never be forced. “I will have mercy on him whom I will have mercy upon.” — The Strange Loop of Grace.

The problem with that is that there are other gods besides Him, so to speak, but they aren't gods but angels appointed over their specific tasks. So, when it says there is nothing besides Him, it has to be taken literally, that none of the things God created have any existence without Him. In a practical vein the actual existence of matter is the condensed light of God. It is not from the empty space but from the light that was drawn into Akudim, the light returned up and the vessels stayed behind and thus became solidified. Because of the breaking of the vessels later on, the matter we see doesn't appear to contain any of that light, as it would have — if not for the breaking of the vessels. But in any case, the actual substance is from the light, not from the empty space. I have thought however that in some way there is a relation to the empty space, but it is probably not true. The real probable cause of the solidification is the very reason why there was a creation in the first place, i.e., the basic “lack” that was in the kindness of God before there was anyone to do kindness to. So, He had to create separate beings from Himself in order to reward them with the highest good, i.e., being one with Him.

King Solomon's audacious decision to marry the daughter of Pharaoh was not a crime of passion, but a calculated act of jurisprudence. He relied on a dangerous but profound principle: Darshinan Taama D'kra —\"We interpret the reason of the verse.\" Solomon argued that if the Torah forbids a king from having many wives \"lest they turn his heart astray,\" then a king whose heart is essentially unturnable is exempt from the restriction. He applied this same logic to the prohibition of Egypt: if the reason is idolatry, and he converts her, the reason vanishes, and so does the prohibition.

The Gemara in Nedarim (20b) presents a conflict of perspective.

But the Halacha follows Rabbi Yochanan (the Amora), who sweeps these restrictions away with a broad principle: \"Anything a person wants to do with his wife he can do.\" While the Rambam interprets this strictly—allowing the acts but not the outcomes (like specific children)—most authorities see it as a carte blanche for connection.

To Rabbi Nachman and Martin Luther salvation is dependent completely on faith, and in particular faith in some saint. However, in the Catholic faith and to the Rambam we find the affirmation of man's dignity and the belief that man could aspire to be like God based on his own efforts. Yet, I would like to suggest that Rabbi Nachman is a bit different than Luther since Luther's idea of faith was negative -- it was a reaction against doubt rooted in his negative feeling about life. Rabbi Nachman's idea of faith was an expression of oneness with the Creator and affirmation of Life. It is faith in God as He is manifested in one's own heart. This is the reason Rabbi Nachman's doctrine doesn't lend itself to authoritarians that want to claim to be his representatives. However, Martin Luther is responsible for the idea of the importance of every person as an individual, not as part of a group, and no one but him can claim authorship of that idea. Freedom from tyranny of another nation was the original redemption from Egypt. Then, only freedom from another nation constituted redemption. There never was a concept of freedom from your own king until 1215.

He is infinitely close to us. Approaching the Infinite Because of this paradox, no matter how close we try to get to God, there are always endless dimensions to traverse. How much closer to infinity is a hundred than one? Not much. If we spend our lives approaching God from the aspect of His infinite distance , we remain far. But if we approach Him from the aspect of His infinite closeness , we find Him immediately. Since God is both infinitely close and far at once (an incomprehensible paradox), the only place one can truly find God is in one's heart, where one feels God. Three Aspects of Divinity There is a force in the world called God. All forces are included in Him, but He is distinct from the forces of nature. We can perceive three aspects: The spiritual level immediately above every individual level. The spiritual level that is inward ( Immanent / Memale Kol Almin ). God as He really is — infinitely above and beyond everything ( Transcendent / Sovev Kol Almin ). \"He hides himself in an infinite series of hidings... so that you do not know that he is hidden.\" This hiding permeates the mental universe of logic and the physical world.

Spinoza argues that Substance (God) includes existence in His essence. He didn't want to define God merely as the \"First Cause\" (because who says the chain must end?), but rather as Existence Itself .

They argued that one cannot leap from an idea to existence . But their objection rests on a misunderstanding. The True Idea vs. The Mere Idea Spinoza wasn't dealing with ordinary ideas. He distinguished between: Idea — A mental representation, which may or may not correspond to reality. True Idea — The essence of a thing, which necessarily corresponds to its object. When Spinoza says God's essence includes existence, he means that the True Idea of God—His essence—logically necessitates His being. The Problem of Self-Reference Russell famously rejected self-referential systems. He proposed a \"hierarchical\" logic to avoid paradoxes—forbidding statements that refer to themselves. But this very principle has been disproven . Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems showed that any sufficiently powerful formal system must contain self-referential statements.

The Bridge to Reality We admit that the laws of logic work in our minds. Kant merely asks: How do we know they work in the outside world? By asking this, he concedes the existence of an \"outside world.\" Since the existence of our own logic is created by some outside cause (not our own minds), the basic pattern of Cause and Effect is not a mental fabrication but an external reality. The Logic of Existence Existence must exist, and nothingness cannot exist. If nothingness \"existed,\" it would not be nothing. You cannot apply the word \"is\" to nothingness. Consider the origin of existence itself: Did existence cause itself? If Before : It didn't exist yet, so it couldn't cause anything. If After : It already existed, so it didn't need a cause. Conclusion: It must have been caused by a Creator who needed no cause to exist but exists in and of Himself.

That is why punishment comes upon them usually as a group as in the Holocaust, but individually their fear of God brings them blessing physically mentally and financially and in their children. The Christians on the other hand are collectively righteous as in America while individually they are usually coarse Goyim. [This is why Christian Evangelists can do miracles only in large groups where all the collective prayers and faith join together to draw the soul of Jesus, while individual Jewish saints generally can do only private miracles.] This is the reason why the Jewish people can't make a nation at peace even within itself much less with the Arab world surrounding it since they lack that outer light. This is the intention of the prophets when they prophesied that the Jewish people would have bad leaders as a result of their sins, i.e., the prophets saw the outer light would be taken from them and replaced by klipot so that the actions of the Jewish people as a whole would be evil though individually each person would be righteous.

To me, that seems ironic, for they claim that the other Jews have gone off the path. It seems that orthodox Judaism has been on a downward-spiral for some time to take the spirituality out of religion. If you'll notice in Hamlet, that Hamlet felt that since in his prayer he hadn't succeed to connect with God, that it wasn't really a prayer. Shakespeare’s whole attitude towards that is that this was in fact the case, for he considers it ironic that he was spared by seeming to pray. So, we see a general attitude that trying to pray isn't necessarily praying, but in orthodox Judaism all the prayers are exactly like that, and if one even attempts to put a little extra into his prayers, he is looked down upon and all the more so if he tries to pray with the intentions of the Kabbalah. [Nowadays, Orthodoxy has become an anti-spiritual movement]. Historically, I believe we can trace a long progression of Orthodox Judaism attempting to take spirituality out of the Torah. No longer is God a weighty subject in Judaism. Now it is the Laws [halacha] for the orthodox, or social justice for the Reform — but God simply has become a concept that is mentioned for the sake of lip service. Thus, we see that the Sanhedrin in the days of Moses tried to convict him for being a false prophet [Korach and the heads of the Sanhedrin as "},{"title":"Chapter 4: Piety — Section XII","chapter":"Chapter 04","url":"en/parts/part_i_philosophy/chapter_04/section_12.html","id":"en-parts-part_i_philosophy-chapter_04-section_12-html","part":"Part I — Philosophy","content":"It is a very worthwhile experience not to get your prayers answered so that you realize that your prayers and trusting on God and your good deeds can't cause God to do your will. This is the case no matter how powerful and deep your prayers are. It is a big ego trip to think that with your prayers you can force him to do your will. Trust and prayer are good things when done with the right viewpoint - that God will do what he knows to be the right thing no matter what. But prayer also can help but only sometimes. There are two ways of approaching tolerance: a) Perhaps tolerance is not a virtue in itself, but what is wrong with the orthodox is that they forget that the Torah says don't add to the commandments, and they keep closing the bubble more and more until there is no room to breathe. (They, of course don't keep these standards. They just sin and repent afterwards. But the conventions are useful in that they provide a way of oppressing everyone else.) Besides that, they are intolerant of behavior outside of their conventions, which have nothing to do with the Torah and many times contradict the Torah. But even the non-religious recognize an outer limit for the bubble. The good thing about the non-religious is that they have an outer limit and inner limit and so have a pretty good idea of where to put the limits of behavior. The religious, however, don't recognize that an inner limit can exist, and they get stricter and make the bubble smaller and smaller until they conden"},{"title":"Chapter 4: Piety — Section XIII","chapter":"Chapter 04","url":"en/parts/part_i_philosophy/chapter_04/section_13.html","id":"en-parts-part_i_philosophy-chapter_04-section_13-html","part":"Part I — Philosophy","content":"The Torah is only to teach us what reason requires. I think ethics is this principle: doing those actions [or words or thoughts] that are in accord with reason and the heart. [I think this way was also the Rambam’s intent though he didn't express it as such.] Thus, there is a certain criteria of reason that if the heart disagrees it means that one's reason is wrong. There is here a basic question for the nature of the standards is different. The traditional way of looking at the laws of the Torah or morality in general is that it is some standard rule of conduct, and that theoretically there is some infinite or finite set of rules for all situations. The Rambam's way is that there is no external set of rules, only internal rules within each person's heart and mind that we may be unaware of because of the physicality of the body that causes us not to hear our minds or heart. Thus, there comes a sign to know if someone actually is going to Gan Eden after they pass away or not. If they have no conscience, i.e., no pangs of guilt when they cause some type of emotional pain or otherwise to another person, that is a sign they are completely out of touch with their heart and mind or that their inner heart and mind have left them and thus they will not go to the light afterwards.

There really is not all that much difference between here and there. So, if you don’t feel any light then believe me, there isn't any. This is why the Torah only promises good in this world for doing the mitzvot. Since the next world is not dependent on mitzvoth, only this world is. However, if you feel the light then in all likelihood you are on the right track for there too. However, since getting there is such a fragile thing it is worth it to have a guarantee. So, this is why it is worth it to get to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, say the ten psalms and give a penny for charity, in which case he promised he would take that person that does this out of hell, an unpleasant place by all accounts. It is forbidden to change one’s religion since it is impossible to get the spiritual blessing except from the root one was born from as already mentioned by the kabbalists from the Middle Ages. But there is another reason, i.e., that religion is the images and stories embedded into one's consciousness when he is young. One can never change that, nor is it desirable to. One can always stick with his own religion and just take out the things that are forbidden. True religion isn't a bunch of rules, it is a way to approach God.

I think this is the Vedic knowledge. The Indus-Saraswati civilization had undergone decay from natural disasters. The arrival of the Vedic people around 1700-1500 BC right after the life of Abraham [which was at the beginning of the second millennium BC] was a rejuvenation — for they brought with them the teachings of Abraham. This explains to me the fact of their strong monotheistic traditions though they still have idolatry and other dualistic traditions. I think this may explain from where they got the idea of meditation which I think is a well-established principle in all religious thought, yet clearly the East got it much before the West. If it wasn't from Abraham, then clearly it must have been from some spiritual giant. Even Judaism today doesn't compare with it, for Judaism has become an anti­spiritual religion by its strictest adherents and obviously it must at least be able to lend itself to an anti-spiritual interpretation. While the Vedas are the most spiritual books that exist in terms of their search for enlightenment and not being able to take anything less as a substitute, even prayer, good deeds, study or even meditation.

Our lack of involvement with it causes the delay of the building of the Temple.” “…and when we will repent on this and occupy ourselves with this wisdom (Kabbalah), the Jewish people will be redeemed.” — Rabbi Chayim Vital in Introduction of the Eitz Chayim. The Failed Expectations The redemption is one of the most painful subjects. All Israel expected the Messiah to come at the end of the second Temple period and deliver them from the Romans. This was correct to expect, since the prophets predicted that the Second Temple would last forever. Well — that prediction proved wrong. Then came Bar Kochba, then assorted saints who tried to bring the Geulah themselves—and all failed.

For instance, some deemphasized the central role of the “Rebbe,” which the Baal Shem Tov (Besht) considered essential. Furthermore, the Besht taught that encountering physical beauty (such as a beautiful woman) is an opportunity to elevate that trait to its higher spiritual root—a practice some later teachers deemed inappropriate for the general populace. Their theological understanding of Divine Oneness also differs. For the Besht, the concept \"There is nothing besides God\" is literal, similar to the non-dualism of Shankara: everything is God, and there is nothing but His Infinite Light.

Know Yourself: Understand your lack and your strength. As the Greeks said, \"Know Thyself.\" Reconnaissance: Like Col. Simons, never go in blind. \"Find Out.\" Situational Awareness: Like a fighter pilot, be aware of the whole sphere, not just the front. Active Waiting: Putting oneself in God's hands does not mean sleeping; it means doing nothing until the clear will of God appears. Trust in God and simplicity. If you don't know something, it is because Vesikin Vesikin —God doesn't want you to know yet. To trust in God means learning to live with doubt until He solves the problem. The Rules of Engagement: Independent Confirmation: Verify what you hear from a source other than yourself. Be Prepared: Like the Boy Scouts. When I went to Ukraine, I was told to take a sleeping bag. I thought it foolish for an indoor trip, but it saved me from freezing. The Ignatius Principle: “In time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm... in the resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding.” (St. Ignatius of Loyola).

The Foundation of the Fall The spiritual biography of the Messiah son of Joseph is rooted in the \"Breaking of the Vessels.\" During the primordial shattering of the world of Nekudim , the vessel of Yesod (Foundation) broke because it could not contain the intense light descending from the higher Sephirot. This broken vessel fell into the lower world of Creation. In the Kabbalistic view, God \"fixed\" this vessel and brought it back into the world of Emanation, empowering it to hold the Light of Chesed (Kindness). Jesus, unified with this trait of Foundation, serves as a spiritual pipeline through which Divine Kindness can flow into a world of broken vessels. Foundation (Prelude) Royalty (Completion) The Role of Joseph The Messiah son of Joseph (Foundation/Yesod) acts as the intermediary. His job is to draw the light of Kindness into the world of action, preparing the way for a deeper structural change. This is the stage of \"Universal Outreach\" where the name of God is spread across the nations.

The Torah also says, “There is nothing besides God.” Coming to this knowledge of the oneness and uniqueness of God -- loving him and fearing him and keeping His commandments -- is what the Torah defines as serving God. Because of the uncertainty principle, there will always be questions on Jesus or any saint that can't be answered. Like the fall of Rome, the crusades, the treatment of Galilio. If you believe in the Torah and the Talmud, there will be questions you can't answer either. The Gemarah in Avodah Zara (pg. 9) says that you shouldn't buy land outside of Israel after 470 AD, for the Redemption will have come already.

(Besides this, Rabbi Abulafia said that the Gemarah in Sukkah regarding the Messiah son of Joseph that it is referring to Jesus.)

The verses later in Daniel 11 say openly that a messiah would arise during the empire that comes after the fall of the Greek empire and that could only be the Roman empire. The Talmud also says that the Messiah would come only when the Roman empire would spread over the whole world.

[This is the literal translation.] Later, the Prophet Hoshea said about this that God appeared to him and served him. [ Hoshea 12:3-6] Now, the sages have a different idea of what happened there, and said it referred to the angel of Esau — which really isn't a problem, for the simple explanation is that God contains all aspects good and evil for there is nothing besides him. Now, if that was God in human form, who we usually refer to as Jesus, it is in fact interesting that Jesus became the intercessor of Esau [Rome]. It is assumed in general that God refers in general to the aspect of God that is above all time and space, but also to each individual level that is one step higher that the previous, which contains the light of God relative to that previous level. As the Sages said about the Tana who explained every Hebrew word ET in the Torah as a ribui — including something else — when he got to the verse that says, “‘ Et’ the Lord your God you shall fear”, he stopped. For what could that ET possibly include? Until Rabbi Akiva came and explained, “‘ Et the Lord your God you shall fear’, to include disciples of the wise.”] [This idea that God is each immediate higher level is actually hinted at in the Torah, where Abraham said to Avimelech, “the gods tricked me into leaving my father’s home” i.e., the set of all the spiritual levels up to God].

[In every generation, there were and will always be one part of the Torah that will be politically incorrect. The Rambam made a somewhat reactionist theology against Christianity but the simple way the sages look at the Torah is thus, as I have written. E.g., when they explained that God called Jacob ‘God’ as Rashi brings down in Genesis that would seem to go against the Rambam that you can't call a person God [the Raavad in fact disagreed with the Rambam and held that believing that God was or can be manifested in a body is not against the Torah]. The Rambam obviously was embarrassed by many laws of the Torah that seem to go against reason, and he had to create a rationalization for them. Nowadays, other parts of the Bible bother us, e.g., when God promises to give the land of Israel to the children of Abraham and then Ishmael is born and God promises to Abraham that Ishmael will fear God.

For a person to come what he must come to he first has to fight evil, then he has to fight God, and then becomes a man. [There is a certain point a person needs to come to, a critical mass, so to speak, for him to start to wake up.] This is represented by the fact that God put the fiery angels before the path to Gan Eden. For one must go through Hell and Heaven to come to the Tree of Life . The angels try to stop one and then if they don't succeed they use their sword. God here also represents Being [the right sepherah Kindness], and Esau non-being [the left sepherah , lack of light].

Rabbi Yochanan in fact says like the Rambam that all the promises of the prophets are for the days of the messiah while the higher spiritual world we can't comprehend. Shmuel says that all the promises are in fact for the higher spiritual world while the only difference between his time [under Babylonian rule] and the time of the messiah will be the subjection of the nations on Israel. That is in fact probably what would have happened if they had accepted the teachings of Jesus [since it was the hot headed nationalists then who provoked the wrath of the Romans and the subsequent exile. But any savior can't do his job unless he is believed in. Even Moses could do nothing with the many people that didn't believe in him, as"},{"title":"Chapter 1: Jesus Christ — Section XIV","chapter":"Chapter 01","url":"en/parts/part_vi_christianity/chapter_01/section_14.html","id":"en-parts-part_vi_christianity-chapter_01-section_14-html","part":"Part VI — Christianity","content":"in me.” And, in fact, his promise to bring that generation into Israel would have been a false prophecy if not for the two people of the generation that did believe in him all the way: Calev Ben Yefune and Hoshea Ben Nun. But at any rate God's purpose will not be thwarted totally, and we find with the introduction of the Magna Carta in the beginning of the 6th millennium when God did promise the redemption, that the yoke of the nations has slowly been lifted off Israel, who are now able to live in relative freedom compared to the chaos and suffering under the Romans and the Dark Ages. In fact, I think that it is possible that Shmuel was referring to messiah of Joseph and Rabbi Yochanan to the messiah from David. And, in fact this is hinted at by the Rambam who brings the statement of Shmuel also, so apparently, he felt that it is possible to reconcile those statements. This, however is not like the gemara which says openly that Rabbi Yochanan and Shmuel disagree. One of the other objections I have heard against Jesus is that his teachings disagree with that of the Sages: however I have found that not to be correct, e.g., Jesus held that a saint has the power to forgive sin as it says in masechta Rosh Hashanah 17b, God forgives the sin of many for the sake of the one and also we find, Moses prayed to God, “forgive their sin and if not, wipe me out of your book”.

One of the objections I have heard against Jesus is that the Sanhedrin of the time killed him. But, the Talmud says that Herod killed all the Rabbis of the Pharisees who had Semichah, and there was left only one Rabbi, Baba Ben Buta — that was when Jesus was only a year old or so. So, when Jesus was about thirty, how could the Sanhedrin have very many true rabbis on it. Where could they have come from, except the Sadducees. Anyway, we find opinions among the Christian scholars that Scribes in the New Testament was changed from the original word ‘Sadducees’. [In the Greek, they are very close. At the time the disciples of Paul were editing the documents to be included in the New Testament the Sadducees were on good terms with them and the scribes and pharisees had become enemies. [On the subject of the stirring dirt and water on Shabbat that Jesus did, cf. Beitza, Chapter 4, in the Rosh [Rabbainu Asher]. Jesus held like Rashi in that Rosh. On the subject of washing the hands, Jesus held like the Gemara in Chulin and the Zohar that the first washing before eating is a mitzvah not an obligation, or he depended on the washing from the morning.

The Rif states the Gemara in Succah for the halacha, so he holds the same way. See the Ritvah in chapter 4 of Rosh Hashanah. The Greek word for picking corn also implies rubbing it between one’s fingers, which is permitted on the Shabbat. It just seems like Jesus and his disciples encountered on the Shabbat ultra-religious Jews who were ignorant of the halachah as happens all the time with people that are super religious — they always keep on adding restriction upon restriction. I have seen many times people doing perfectly permitted things on the Sabbath and getting attacked by the ultra-orthodox, who simply didn't know the halachah — and even when the Shulchan Aruch [Code of Jewish Law] was brought out to show them, they wouldn't believe it. It is also interesting to note that Jesus said the same idea as the Rambam in The Guide . Jesus said the Shabbat was given for man. The Rambam wrote that the object of the entire Torah, in general, is the well-being of the body and the soul — and specifically, the Shabbat was given to witness the fact that God created the world, and to give man rest and comfort.

This explains references that Jesus and Paul made to verses predicting his death that we don't have in our present day Bible. A further objection I have heard is against the virgin birth. Christians usually bring a proof to the virgin birth from Isaiah 7:14. Jewish people arguing against them point out that the word “ almah ” doesn't mean a virgin but a young girl. However, the Jewish commentary, the Even Ezra explains, “It is probable that it means virgin or a girl who has had sex,” i.e., either one is equally likely. [Besides that, one could always answer from the verse in Genesis that the Sons of God came in unto the daughters of man and they gave birth.] One important proof of Jesus is very simple. If physics would teach people to be good and those that learned it would be not good then we would have a question about its validity. But now that it teaches about physical reactions and those reactions occur as it predicts, then we have no question.

We ask the angels for blessings on Friday night. At what point does praying to a trait of God not constitute idolatry and to a stone yes? Aren't they both creations of God? The Rambam explains that the prohibition on idolatry refers to the way idolatry originally started — that is, the generation of Enosh saw the stars in Heaven, and reasoned that since God has attributed honor to these creations it is right that we do so also, and so they started worshiping them. Since the main prohibition of idolatry is dependent on the intention, if one prays to something thinking of it as a creation separate from God it is idolatry. But if he prays to it knowing that it is only a manifestation of God it is not.

What makes it worse than other mistakes is that it depends on what one makes a mistake about. Making a mistake about mundane things isn't so bad as making a mistake about God. However, most authorities, even in the Talmud don't hold this way, and until this day it is the custom of Jews everywhere to go to their holy men for a blessing. And even the Rambam can't get away from the middleman for he says, [ The Guide III:52], that the Intellect is the middleman between one and God. [You can't complain about the Rambam speaking about every mitzvah being a middleman. For he would say every mitzva isn't to attach you to God but to give you the right opinions]. The prohibition of idolatry is to serve any of the creations of God, not a prohibition to pray or ask a favor from any creation, while knowing that it is in God's hands, for we ask saints for a blessing, and we go to a bakery to ask for bread, and on the night of the Shabbat we ask the angels to bless us.

The Metric of Longevity Rabbi Nachman’s teachings provide a platform for a new \"Experimental Kabbalah.\" While many spiritual claims are abstract, the assertion that the Torah and Shabbat provide physical life is a hypothesis that can be tested statistically. By measuring the life expectancy of religious and non-religious cohorts—averaging out variables like lifestyle and geography—one can verify the physical impact of spiritual observance. The soul is not just a mystical concept; it is a variable in the biological equation of survival. General Principles Individual Application The Collective Light The Likutei Moharan outlines general laws of human nature. These laws serve to show the inter-relationship between ideas—how prayer affects health, or how truth affects wealth. In the aggregate, these principles hold true across the spiritual dataset of the Jewish people. Vessel of Correction The Singular Path When a general principle hits the individual vessel, it changes dramatically. The \"Light of Chaos\" is drawn into the unique \"Vessel of Correction\" that is each person's life.

While every person has their own unique set of coefficients, the values remain relatively stable within a peer group. Using the F-statistic of faith, one can test whether a specific practice truly contributes to their overall salvation, allowing them to focus their time and energy on the variables that provide the highest spiritual return. Additive Effects Synergetic Repentance The Sum of Mitzvot We assume that the effects of various Variable (Israel, Succah, Prayer) are additive. Doing one does not diminish the inherent value of the other; they accumulate in the soul’s ledger to produce a final result of peace and prosperity. Linear Growth The Recursive Chain Repentance ( Teshuvah ) is an exponential function.

The Shear Wave of Time Time is not a linear progression but a complex \"Shear Wave\" traveling through a four-dimensional time field.

A single year consists of four primary waves: the Rosh Hashanah wave (starting at the New Year), the Month wave (starting in Nissan), the Week wave, and the Day wave. Each of these waves exists at right angles to the other, creating a multidimensional lattice of temporal energy where the highest point of \"Potential\" is found on the holiday of Shavuot and the lowest in the depth of Tisha BeAv. Inner Essence Gravitational Time The Unity of the Singularity Rabbi Nachman predicts the existence of black holes and singularities.

However, the true measure of a person's soul is not their y-coordinate (rank/starting point) but their x-coordinate —their horizontal closeness to the \"Vertical Column of Infinite Light.\" A person on a high rung (born into a pious family) who remains far from the column is less spiritual than a person on a low rung (a newcomer or non-Jew) who draws closer to the light.

However, unattachment to God as when one's mind is occupied with things separate from God, is idolatry. Yet, by faith that there is nothing besides Him, one can serve God by himself himself all things. Rabbi Nachman apparently hold s that prayer is above Torah, and the Talmud says learning Torah [even one word -- the mishnah in Peah makes clear that there is no lower limit to the amount, i.e., even an infinitesimal amount of learning is more than all the commandments -- which includes prayer] is above all mitzvot . One [Rabbi Nathan’s] explanation is that prayer for physical things is below Torah, as the sages mentioned about the student in an incident that he was praying when he should have been learning. Yet this isn't a good answer since Rabbi Yochanan disagrees in that very case and says, “If only a person would pray all day”. A later Chassidic teaching says that in the latter days things have changed. When we reflect on it, we can see the point. For the root of the Torah is the Name 45 and the root of the mitzvot is 52 and so perhaps after a certain point in time the flow of light shifted from going down [the name 45] to going up [52] , so that now prayer connects one to the flow of l"},{"title":"Chapter 4: Final Ideas — Section V","chapter":"Chapter 04","url":"en/parts/part_v_ideas/chapter_04/section_05.html","id":"en-parts-part_v_ideas-chapter_04-section_05-html","part":"Part IV","content":"reason why people’s lives are a series of ups and downs -- and the ups and downs get more frequent as time goes by but less dramatically, since the radius of curvature increases proportionally to how far you are from the origin [your birth].
