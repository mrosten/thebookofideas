The light from understanding (Binah) is related to the electromagnetic force, in that the hashmal outer covering of Zeir and Nukbah come from it. Binah is composed of higher and lower levels, as the Ari goes into at great length.</p>
            <p>B= 0 (H+M) (B is the entire induction field of Binah, Binah Ilaah (The higher Understanding) is the magnetic field H, Tvunah is the density M). For the Chashmal (electricity) to emanate from Binah, Binah has to be rotating in relation to Zeir and Nukbah (the two sephirot of Beauty and Royalty) The simple explanation of the light that is left in the vessels as the main light goes back up is that it is like light that shines on the surface of something and the surface heats up because of the energy that got absorbed. The question is what in the world is the second light that Rabbi Luria says is left there?! (I would suggest that it refers to the photo-electric effect.) The 22 Hebrew letters have numerical value, but they also represent functions.</p>

The normal distribution coming from sephiros deYosher is the reason the light of nekudim</p>
