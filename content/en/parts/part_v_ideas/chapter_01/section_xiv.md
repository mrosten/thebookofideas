<p>1 0 for all c: And so, the Wronskian determinant doesn't vanish at the origin. So, the torsion 1 0 So we have either right handed or left handed sephirot since,</p>

            <p>However, the general system according to the Kabbalah is that the top row of the matrix is the beginning letters of every word of the verse, the middle row of the matrix is the middle letters, and the last row is the last letters of each word. So, for example the first verse is a 3 times 7 matrix. The reason the world is 3 dimensional is that it is built by the Divine name 72 which consists of three letters for each name which are each orthogonal to each other. [This is based on the verse “the world is built by kindness”. The name 72 corresponds to the Divine trait of Kindness.] ·· The 4 times 4 matrix of the four Divine names 72 63 45 52 is:</p>
