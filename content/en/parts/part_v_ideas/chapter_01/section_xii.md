<p>Wisdom will have integer-spin like Photons or in general any particles whose exchange generates some interaction. This is a problem, for bosons carry all the interactions -- so aren't there left-handed interactions from the sephirot of power? The answer is that there are only four interactions, from the names 72 (right), 63 (left), 45 (right), 52 (left), and the four are always symmetric until some Higgs field breaks the symmetry. Since Royalty and Beauty are rotating on their own axis, they emit wave radiation from of the four types of waves (72, 63, 45, 52). Since Royalty rotates around Beauty they consist of a closed system, and give off Name-72 waves, which involves a loss of their energy of motion and rest energy. Therefore, they need to receive more energy into order to keep up the oscillation. (If not, they just float away as name 72 radiation waves.</p>
            <p>The singularity in the center of the empty space is a white hole not surrounded by an event horizon, which spews out spiritual mass and energy, not subject to the laws of spiritual physics. It has its own circular and straight sephirot outside of it. Its surface is our four dimensional world. The inside I think is a different type of continuation of the process of the evolving of the spiritual worlds in the regular empty space. †</p>

            <p>TNT is Typographical Number Theory. Since the whole universe is analytic it can be expanded into a Taylor series (that's why one needs to get married i.e., in order to continue the series.) The circular sephirot are analytic but the straight sephirot are not. But the bottom seven sephirot of the generality of the worlds [all taken as one] are analytic because they are like cylinders. Sephirot are a vector space since the operations of addition and multiplication apply to them. Multiplication by the sephirot is what the kabbalah calls mating, for addition is just adding two things [of the same essence] together, while mating is applying the value of one thing to the value of another in order to come out with a greater (or lesser) result.</p>
            <p>The circular sephirot are analytic since they have a derivative everywhere. I don't</p>
