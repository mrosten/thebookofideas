<p>elementary particles and the forming of atoms. Perhaps the universe is expanding inside another 5-D universe which is expanding inside a 6-d universe etc., to infinity. Perhaps the physical expansion of the Universe in 3-Dimensional space is due to the fact that the universe is described by a matrix. The determinant of that matrix gives the volume of the universe. Space is a set of infinities (Cantor's Infinities), (these are the substances of Spinoza). This is the deeper meaning of the infinities of the electron.</p>
            <p>The 1 st 100 elements were divided into 10 sephirot, e.g., hydrogen is royalty of royalty, helium is Foundation of Royalty . (After the correction helium is Royalty of Foundation .) It seems possible that the 12 elementary substances that The Book of Creation (sefer Yetzirah) refers to, are the six quark flavors and six leptons. The 8-gluons of the strong interaction plus the two gluons of the electro­-weak interaction (the photon and weak boson), are the light of the sephirot of the physical universe. It’s amazing that in the Eitz Chayim , in the description of akudim , we find light interacting with light which predicted the existence of gluons besides the photon. The 6 quarks are the 6 sephirot of Zeir Anpin , cgt + nhi</p>
