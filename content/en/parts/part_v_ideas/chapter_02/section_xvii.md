<p>how long the creation of the physical universe was. The contradiction between the Divine fore-knowledge and free will is that God knows what one will chose not just from the future but from now (i.e. not just because He knows the future). This contradiction is the root of Quantum Mechanics. Creativity on the right side of the brain is from the sepherah of Wisdom. Order is from the left from the sepherah of Understanding. Logical creativity which relates to order, and a deeper creativity, is the combination of the two called Knowledge — but all three permeate the entire body as it says in Drush HaDaas at the end of the Eitz Chayim.</p>
            <p>The deeper creativity is much more covered, and with the vessel of Eternity Splendor and Foundation of Understanding and Eternity, Splendor and Foundation of Wisdom. (This last comment is referring just to Emanation, which is different than the whole picture referred to in Drush HaDaas.) Thus, we find creative people who aren't smart — because smartness in general is from the sepherah of understanding which is open and quick to understand. But the deeper sepherah of Wisdom is slow and not quick to understand, but after a long process of absorbing the idea, it is able to create something totally new — which the left-brain people reject, because it's too off-beat for them. Thus, we find that Einstein was a slow learner.</p>
            <p>Everything under the level of the lower six sephirot (which are opposites) turns into its opposite and then back again, in constant oscillation. So we find the enlightened Islam of the middle ages becoming the barbaric Islam of today, and the dark Christianity of the Middle Ages becoming the loving Christianity of today. The same loving Chasidut of the Baal Shem Tov has become the fascist Chasidut of today. Only by one rising up to the level of the 3 first sephirot can one escape this pattern. I think science is in its root on that level (i.e.</p>
            <p>what the sages call the higher wisdom) However when science falls from its higher root it can become just a tool for evil (the Torah is on the level of Beauty one of the lower sephirot.) When the angel called out, “Abraham Abraham” and he said “here I am” and he said “put out not your hand to the child, and do nothing to him for now I know that you fear God, and you have not withheld your son, your only one from me.” (Or more literally your singularity from me i.e. the center part of his being i.e. the center of the black hole.)</p>
