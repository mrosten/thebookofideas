<p>have the number of the children of God. This isn't apikorsus to believe — unless you want to say too that Rashi was an apikorus . To tell the truth, modern orthodoxy would consider the Rambam also to be an apikorus. The oral law are the meanings that the written text triggers, and the written law is the open and hidden meanings that are contained in the text itself. In reality, there is no way to totally understand the meaning of any verse of the torah since that would mean understanding the implications of its connections to every person until the end of time. That is why there is no infallible method for telling true from false statements in number theory —because statements imply meaning, which has infinite levels. [GEB, p. 561, 582] The dichotomy between Relativity and quantum mechanics is possibly related to the Strange Loops in Mathematical logic, i.e.,  relativity is from the sephirot of Yosher, and quantum reality is from Igulim.</p>
            <p>There is a special type of holiness the Patriarchs handed down one to the other. This is the subject of the blessings. This is different than a normal blessing one gives to another but a special type of holiness in quality and quantity. This came to Joseph as Rashi explains on the verses of the blessing Yakob gave to him. Rashi says there “The blessing of the Patriarchs”. Thus the Jewish people are only the physical descendants of the Patriarchs. To find the people that received the blessing of Joseph one would have to know where his two tribes went to, for the Jewish people today are Judah and Benjamin. It seems there is a different spiritual Israel, different than the Jewish people that received this blessing.</p>
            <p><sup>[28]</sup> Each sentence of the Torah has a noun which is the root of matter and a verb which is the root of energy.So the four worlds corresponding to the four Hebrew words for doing or making refer to the four forces.The strong force- physicality.The weak force-formation. The electromagnetic force-creation.Gravitation Emanation.</p>
