<p>physical realm contains a letter. When we find that the letters themselves come in this way, it seems to be a confirmation of string theory in Kabbalah, though it is far from confirmed in the physical realm. [I know that looks suspiciously like the tertiary structures of the proteins.] This is probably superfluous to mention but I find it very interesting that the DNA molecule have 26 parts which is the numerical value of the Four letter name of God éä”åä which relates to the sepherah of Beauty which is the sepherah of Man. The bases GTCA clearly are the four letters Aleph Dalet Nun Yod, thus:</p>

            <p>And their inner root is Yod He Vav He and the specific shape of the letter Aleph determines the structure of the DNA, i.e., the bottom “kotz” is the base, or Malchut... [The Vav is an extended Yod.] The fifteen operations are the numerical value of the first two letters é”ä. Now, here the connections are clear, but what would be the result of knowing this I don't know. I suspect that with this knowledge each discipline can teach about the other, but this job is usually left for the discoverer of the idea itself. Each nucleotide is made up of three letters which correspond to the division of the name 72 into groups of three letters each: [ {acid(ACGT), base(phosphate), sugar(ribose)} = {judgement, beauty, kindness}.] There are 10 nucleotides per revolution which corresponds to the  10 letters of the name 45. The DNA is Kindness and Judgement together [the name 72 and 42, each containing ten four-letter names as the inner light].</p>
            <p>Out of this combination comes the mRNA [beauty, the name 22]. It goes through the three lower sephirot Eternity, Splendor, Foundation -- and out comes Royalty: the proteins. ·33 Even though there is no known way of summing up all infinitely many Feynman diagrams, to get an expression for a fully renormalized electron, I think the secret may be contained in an idea along these lines: the area under the curve of y=1/x is finite even though it is infinitely long i.e.,</p>

            <p>. Thus, there is a way for the strange loops that encompass creation to be brought down to one point</p>
