<p>found the connection. The new ideas in the field of chaos also illustrate this. These are indicative of inner connections that cause dissimilar things to be connected by the same laws. [Something connected with this is the fact that the Schwarzschild radius comes out to be exactly the same as if it was formulated in Newtonian terms thus: 1/2mv 2 = GmM/r,so R=2GM/c2] [Also in basic first year Physics, some of the laws of different systems turn out identical, both in mechanics and in electro-magnetism.] The microscopic world is based on probability while the macroscopic world is based on classical physics. The connection is that between the world of chaos and of correction. Chaos is the higher root but then from the elements of chaos (atoms) God created the macroscopic world based on correction. Spiritually also we are only microscopically subject to the laws of chaos but our macroscopic souls are based on correction. So its true that individual prayer depends on not being observed only on the higher level of chaos but there still is a level of correction where flow exists despite being observed.</p>
            <p>The number of laws of the Torah (10 general, 613 specific) equals the number of the components of the field of the empty space (i.e. 10 sephirot, and 613 parts of the soul). Of the Ten Commandments only the last 6 determine the rate of spiritual change while the first 4 limit the initial conditions, but allow for any arbitrary rate of change (this is if you go by the divisions of the Hebrew Bible and count every paragraph as one commandment. This is actually how the Catholic Church divides them.)) The reason for the division 6 and 4 is that the letter He (the 5 colors) divides up into a Vav (6) and a Dalet (4) as it comes down through the world of waves (Akudim). Then the Vav is divided into two Vavs, 6 quarks and 6 leptons. From here it seems that the 6 quarks and leptons come from the 6 field equations of General Relativity that determine future events.</p>
            <p>The determinant of the matrix that determines the universe isn't equal to zero, so that matrix has to have a unique solution — and so it has to have the same number of variables as equations. I think that gives a 4x4 matrix, since the variables are the position in space and time. ·26 The inverse-square laws of the universe come as one equation:</p>
