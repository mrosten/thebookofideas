<p>There is a spiritual space and time just like the physical. The laws of the spiritual space-time continuum are the Divine Names and unifications which are parallel to the mathematical formulas in the physical realm. (This explains the idea that Yom Kippur is above time i.e., the spiritual time-flow, not the physical. Also, this explains different statements of the Sages about the universe, which seem to contradict the physical one (as the Ramchal says). Why then is math and physics considered holy to the Rambam? — because if it is connected to fear of God it is the vessel for the higher holiness, and the explanation of the higher sepherot, and the singularity of the infinite light in the center of the empty space makes it the center of the physical realm.</p>
            <p>Also, since Royalty is connected directly to the Crown, when it goes up it is immediately attached to the Crown — similar to the fact that the highest holiness can be reached only in the physical world by doing the physical commandments, not in the higher worlds, for only here shines the light of the Crown. Also, the hidden holiness of science and math stems from the fact that the formulas are the Divine unifications of the circular sephirot. Darkness, which the Talmud implies is a creation in itself refers to the electro-magnetic field that permeates the universe which isn't ether but a mathematical field which obeys Einstein's laws and has a separate existence in itself besides light — (see Looking for the Harmonies by Frank Wilczek, p.g. 346 note 161).</p>
            <p>It's amazing how in nature totally unconnected events have the same laws connecting them, like the number of ways “h” heads will appear if we toss a coin “n” times which is: †</p>
