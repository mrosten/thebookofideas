<p>To sweeten the judgments, I would recommend having in every city at least one person learning Zohar, Lekutei Moharan and other kabbalah books in such a way that when he is tired there is another to take his place and continue from the place he stopped. [See Ginzay HaRamchal where I got this idea from.] This would be good in particular by the graves of the righteous where the lower level of their soul hovers. For the individual can say the ten psalms of Rabbi Nachman, 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150 which are on the level of the crown, then the Song of songs on the level of wisdom, then Numbers ch. 28, on the level of understanding than Exodus chapt. 28:15 to 28:30, then Exodus 26:7 to 26:15; the part about the increase in the prayer book, the two blessings that Moses blessed the tribes at the end of Deuteronomy and the divine chariot in Ezikiel.</p>
