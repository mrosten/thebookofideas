<p>The exact difference between Rabbi Nachman and the Medieval Authorities of the Torah is the same as the Difference between Martin Luther and the Catholic Church. To Rabbi Nachman and Martin Luther salvation is dependent completely on faith, and in particular faith in some saint. However, in the Catholic faith and to the Rambam we find the affirmation of man's dignity and the belief that man could aspire to be like God based on his own efforts. Yet, I would like to suggest that Rabbi Nachman is a bit different than Luther since Luther's idea of faith was negative -- it was a reaction against doubt rooted in his negative feeling about life. Rabbi Nachman's idea of faith was an expression of oneness with the Creator and affirmation of Life. It is faith in God as He is manifested in one's own heart.</p>
            <p>This is the reason Rabbi Nachman's doctrine doesn't lend itself to authoritarians that want to claim to be his representatives. However, Martin Luther is responsible for the idea of the importance of every person as an individual, not as part of a group, and no one but him can claim authorship of that idea. Freedom from tyranny of another nation was the original redemption from Egypt. Then, only freedom from another nation constituted redemption. There never was a concept of freedom from your own king until 1215. The Magna Carta, which was 25 years before the year 5000 in the Jewish calendar -- when the 2 nd redemption started -- constitutes freedom in such a way that even the government of your own country can't infringe on your freedom.</p>
            <p>The idea of freedom of the individual arose only at the time of Martin Luther. [Later I noticed that Hegel also saw history as progress towards freedom]. The Redemption is from the sepherah of Binah understanding and the more the light of this sepherah is revealed in the world the more redemption there is since “all freedom comes from Understanding” Yet the Sages also said “judgements are awoken from Understanding”. So, freedom has brought a price with it. For in the Middle Ages there was a large degree of security for the individual. There were the guilds [unions] which provided steady work. The financial reality was local and personal and not based on greed but on life and people. The real purpose of life was salvation. Greed was one of the cardinal sins. This attitude affected how business was done. The</p>
