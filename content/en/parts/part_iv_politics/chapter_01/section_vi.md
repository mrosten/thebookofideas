<p>Rambam holds that one can accept a ger toshav From Amalek. Therefore, in his opinion the seven commandments of Noach take even the Seven nations or Amalek out of the category of Milchemet Mitzvah. Since the mitzvot of obligatory war and non-obligatory war are semuchim [adjacent] they are parallel. Therefore, the seven mitzvot take other nations out of the category of non-obligatory war [to the Rambam]. This provides a different basis of looking at non-Jews other than the accepted way. The accepted way however is the opinion of the authorities brought in Shulchan Aruch. At any rate even to the other authorities, taxation on other nations is a political necessity. One nation in the world has to be the policeman.  The reason one state in America isn't a threat to another is that the Federal government is over them all.</p>
            <p>Freedom is an implicit principle in the Torah for even if we accept the principle of making a fence that the majority of the Sages held by the fence still has to be around the laws themselves and not infringe on personal or public and individual freedoms more than absolutely necessary for the continuance and fulfillment of the Biblical laws. [and in fact, if the majority of the people don't accept the rabbinical law it has no validity anyway which is why the oil of non-Jews is permitted even though it was from the 18 rabbinical laws of Hillel and Shamai.] In fact, the whole baal tshuva movement and the orthodox Judaism of today are really just escapes from freedom. For modern man in general is terrified of freedom and so within the disguise of the Torah they still have to make up more and more restrictions and justify it by pretending that the Bible requires it. Now it is true that freedom per say is not an important principle in the Torah, but the Torah has an idea much more powerful: Don't add and don't subtract from these laws. So, with the giving of the Torah God created the social national body of Jewry but took away from the government the ability to impose its’ man made restrictions.</p>
            <p>The church in its inception felt they could take anything beautiful or good or true in the pagan society they lived and incorporate it into their practice. Throughout the centuries the church has adapted and incorporated many of the customs of the people of the area it went into. The failure of the church to adapt to the customs of India and China and learn from the many good traditions they have, has defeated its progress there. Judaism has much to learn from this. Rather than abandoning the basic principle of the Torah [belief in the Oral and Written Law] as the alternative movements have done in Judaism, we should keep the principles but also not be afraid to learn what is good and</p>
