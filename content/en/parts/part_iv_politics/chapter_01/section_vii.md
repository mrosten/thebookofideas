<p>beautiful from others.True Torah life can take root among all Jews, but it must adapt to the sensitivities and nature of the people in each area and community. Any attempt to impose the fascist Judaism of Brooklyn and the ultra-orthodox in Israel on the rest of Jewry will fail.The Baal Shem Tov and his followers were the last leaders to know this principle. [It so happens that they were saints also, but in practical terms they also knew the need to adapt to the people and see the higher spiritual root of each community they were in. Many of the customs they explained the higher spiritual significance of were indigenous to those communities and not customs carved in stone for all people everywhere.</p>
            <p>This was the attitude of the rabbis of the Talmud also. However, those were unique times for in general God has promised the Jewish people that   their rabbis and leaders would be evil and misguide them. Thus, rabbi Yochanan cried every time he came to that verse that said this and he said a servant whose master has promised to misguide him what hope is there for him. I, however, can answer this. Ignore the rabbis and do rather what you know the Torah to be saying. One could ask, “Isn't the Torah the exact equivalent of fascism?” Isn't its stated aim to achieve world dominion and to enslave all the nations of the world to the Jewish nation and to kill all Jews that don't keep the Torah as they do and all nations that don't submit to their rule? The answer would be to this, that the European nations are actually from the ten tribes, and the rest of the world, in as far as they accept Christianity or Islam, come into the category of Gerei Toshav [semi-converts] and the Torah obviously isn't saying to enslave them since there is an explicit command to make sure they are provided for, i.e. if they have enough for themselves — fine, and if not, you are required to give them charity. Incidentally, a Ger Toshav according to one opinion in Mesechet Gerim, is someone who accepts on themselves not to do idolatry [which, as I have mentioned, includes even the Catholic church — according to the Rashba and the Meiri — since they aren't worshiping the statues but using them to concentrate on the souls of the saints they represent, and ask them to pray for them, or for their blessing which the Sages say is permitted and in fact said that a person that has a sick person at home must go to the sage of his city to ask him to pray for him.] Only with regard to idolatrous nations does the Torah say to conquer or be conquered.</p>
            <p>This explanation doesn't help King David however, for he went to conquer for profit, but I do have an explanation of King David i.e., that he said go conquer a “troop”, i.e., people that were going to pillage. [I believe this is a very important new thought. However, this isn't to all authorities as we see in the Shulchan Aruch. But this answer is in accordance with the spirit of the Rambam who puts Goyim that are scientists and philosophers on a higher level than the Jewish people and he wouldn't agree with going around killing and pillaging the goyim and taking those who surrender for slaves and tribute.]</p>
