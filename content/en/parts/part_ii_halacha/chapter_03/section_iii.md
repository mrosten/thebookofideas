<p>Paper money is allowed to be handled on the Sabbath since it isn't in the category of what the Gemarah calls “maot” [coins] it is rather in the category of Business documents which one isn't allowed to read. (This is like the Rambam. However many other Rishonim hold business documents are muktzah.) The only permission to handle coins that I know of is Rashi on page 143a of Shabbat that the bones there are “hard and not fit for a dog” and rav Nachman in the gemara says that is the opinion of Beit Hillel. [There is the other Stam Mishna on page 142b, which obviously holds coins are muktza — so we have stam against stam .] Brushing teeth on the Shabbat with toothpaste is permitted. The melachah where some people get the idea that it is prohibited from is the melachah of smoothing dirt or some substance over a surface like a stove to cover it up which has nothing to do with brushing teeth.</p>
            <p>Things that are forbidden on the Shabbat sewing cooking [heating food to over 160 Fahrenheit] carrying anything from an area surrounded by three walls to a public domain where 600,000 people pass daily. To the Rambam a public domain is any road that is 16 amot [32 feet] wide even if that many people don't pass daily. Writing in Hebrew [I imagine the old Ivri script is also forbidden since the Gemara says the Torah was given in that script. The Torah was given in Ivri script but in the Hebrew language. Eventually the Jewish people decided on the Ashuri script. Some Medieval authorities think that this Gemara isn't literal and want to say that the Torah was given in Ashuri script, but it seems to me that it is about as clear as you can get.]. Carrying anything in a public domain four amot [8 feet] [Clothing and jewelry that is worn is permitted.</p>
            <p>Separating the chaff from the wheat. It is forbidden to go to the mikvah on Friday  afternoon since that is the time the klipot gather to try to come into holiness and the place they do this is the mikvah.For this reason it is forbidden to pray in a synagogue which is the place of the klipot in general since the klipot try to find the places of holiness and to enter people that go there.</p>
