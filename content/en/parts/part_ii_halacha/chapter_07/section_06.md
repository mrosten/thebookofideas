            <h4>The Scope of Intimacy</h4>
            <p>The Gemara in Nedarim (20b) presents a conflict of perspective. Rabbi Yochanan ben Dahavai lists restrictions on intimacy: not face-to-back, not to kiss "that spot," and avoiding conversation during the act. But the Halacha follows Rabbi Yochanan (the Amora), who sweeps these restrictions away with a broad principle: <em>"Anything a person wants to do with his wife he can do."</em> While the Rambam interprets this strictly—allowing the acts but not the outcomes (like specific children)—most authorities see it as a carte blanche for connection.</p>

            <strong>The Puzzle of Light</strong>
            The Gemara mentions the "House of Munbaz" who were praised for being intimate during the day due to necessity. I think this might imply a wider range of permission than usually assumed. However, the limit remains firm:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>The Jacob Proof:</strong> We know Jacob did not have a light on; otherwise, how could he not have known it was Leah? This suggests that total darkness is the ideal ancient standard.</li>
            <li><strong>The Candle Question:</strong> While the Gemara forbids sex by the light of a lamp, I suspect there may be room for leniency in other opinions (perhaps implied in the Mishnah or Yerushalmi), though I haven't found a concrete source to permit it yet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Limits of Honor</h4>
            <p>A second boundary exists in the home: the honor due to parents. If a parent transgresses the Torah, do we still honor them?
            <br>The <strong>Samag</strong> and <strong>Tur</strong> say no. The <strong>Rambam</strong> agrees only if they transgress <em>knowingly</em> (B'Mezid).
            <br>There is a distraction here between "citizenship" and "treason":
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Citizens:</strong> Those who don't keep the Torah out of ignorance are simply not in the category of "your people" regarding this law.</li>
            <li><strong>Enemies of the State:</strong> Those who know the Truth and rebel against it are in a worse category. They sever the bond of honor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But when the mitzvah <em>does</em> apply, the Yerushalmi calls it <strong>"the severest of the severe."</strong></p>
