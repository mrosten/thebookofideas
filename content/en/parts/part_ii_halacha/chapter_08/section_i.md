            <h4>Torah for its Own Sake</h4>
            <p>The study of Torah is a communion with the Divine Mind, a process that requires absolute purity of intent. The Rambam draws a hard line: One is forbidden to learn Torah with the plan of using it to earn a living. The wisdom is a gift, a frequency of light that cannot be sold. While modern authorities like Rabbi Israel Salanter permitted being a functional Rabbi as a "need of the hour," the core principle remains: To turn the words of God into a spade to dig with is to desecrate the sanctity of the transmission.</p>

            <strong>The Economics of Spirit</strong>
            The tension between modern life and ancient law creates two distinct camps:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>The Rambam's Ideal:</strong> One must work for a living and learn for the soul. Receiving money for Torah turns a "Living Light" into a dead commodity. It risks losing one's portion in the World to Come.</li>
            <li><strong>The Tashbatz's Reality:</strong> To preserve the tradition in a distracted world, a scholar may depend on the community. This is a "legal fiction" necessary for survival, but it changes the nature of the learning from pure communion to professional duty.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>The Gender of Knowledge</h4>
            <p>The Talmud records a jarring statement from Rabbi Eliezer: "It is better for words of the Torah to be burned than to be given into the hands of women." This is not about intelligence or capability. It is about the "Vessel." The Torah is "Fire." If Fire is placed in a vessel not designed to hold it (structurally), the vessel breaks. The "hands of women" represent a specific mode of reception (Binah/Understanding) that is different from the transmission mode (Chochmah/Wisdom) of the active study. The restriction is a safeguard for the integrity of the light itself.</p>
