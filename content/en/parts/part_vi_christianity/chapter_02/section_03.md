            <h4>The Spirit of the Church</h4>
            <p>I heard from Issac Ram that the Catholic Church has the spirit of Jesus even though they practice forms of idolatry. The more liberal denominations of the church act as a meeting place between Western thought and Jesus, but the spirit of Jesus is really there only in trace amounts.</p>

            <h4>The Disciples vs. Paul</h4>
            <p>The disciples of Jesus—those who knew him and whom he chose (as he said "I have chosen you")—suspected that Paul was telling people not to keep the commandments. They sent for him, and he came to Jerusalem to defend himself. He claimed he was only telling non-Jews that they didn't have to become Jewish to be saved, but that he never told Jews not to keep the commandments. To prove his observance, he even performed rituals in the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
            
            <p>Later, however, the disciples became suspicious again and sent Peter to investigate. As it turned out, their suspicion was correct, as we see in Paul's own letters.</p>

            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
                "The righteous shall live by his faith." — Habakkuk 2:4 (Paul's Justification)
            </blockquote>

            <h4>The Evidence of the Letters</h4>
            <p>These letters were written over several years and perhaps represent Paul's evolving ideas, but they clearly outline a doctrine that the original disciples of Jesus considered false—so much so that they threatened to excommunicate him. Paul's letters reveal a fundamental shift: the replacement of the Laws of God with the new rituals of the Church.</p>
            
            <p>In his letter to the Galatians [Gal. 2:6, in 57AD], Paul writes about the disciples of Jesus who were the leaders of the church in Jerusalem: <em>“those people who are acknowledged as leaders — not that their importance matters to me.”</em> In 2 Corinthians 11:3-4, he acknowledges that the disciples of Jesus were teaching about "another Jesus" different from the one he was preaching.</p>

                <strong>Paul's Motivation</strong>
                Perhaps Paul held like Rashi in <em>Makkot 24</em> ("The righteous shall live by his faith"), attempting to condense the Torah into a single principle of Faith/Love to make it accessible to the pagan world. However, his hatred of the Law seems to have gone beyond simplification into nullification.
