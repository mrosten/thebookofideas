<p>gates], not idolaters. In the old Kabbalah we find prayers addressed to the sephirot [traits] of God. We find an Amora going to the grave of his father saying, “Save me! Save me!” — from his enemies. We ask the angels for blessings on Friday night. At what point does praying to a trait of God not constitute idolatry and  to a stone yes? Aren't they both creations of God? The Rambam explains that the prohibition on idolatry refers to the way idolatry originally started — that is, the generation of Enosh saw the stars in Heaven, and reasoned that since God has attributed honor to these creations it is right that we do so also, and so they started worshiping them.</p>
            <p>Since the main prohibition of idolatry is dependent on the intention, if one prays to something thinking of it as a creation separate from God it is idolatry. But if he prays to it knowing that it is only a manifestation of God it is not. [Though this above idea may seem strange to many people however we find Rava in the Gemara [and the Rambam hold as law] that even if one bows down to a statue for love or fear of the statue, he hasn't transgressed the prohibition of idolatry until he accepts it as a god, i.e. he believes it to have a separate existence besides God.</p>
            <p>If a person would believe that God has put his name on a stone, [i.e., he believes the stone is a manifestation of God and has no separate power or existence besides God], even though this is a mistake, and that person bows down to the stone, it isn't idol worship legally since in his mind, he is worshiping God. [In the language of the Gemara, “He didn't accept the stone for godliness”.] It isn't even “Shogag” [accidental] since the prohibition depends on the thought. That is why going to the graves of the saints or bowing down in front of a Torah scroll isn't idol worship, since the people that do so believe that God has placed His name on that thing.</p>
            <p>This explains why many of the first authorities held that the Christians aren't idol worshipers. This also explains why the desire for money is actual idolatry [to all the Sages of Chasidut]. This is idolatry, since even the people that do this don't believe that God has placed his Name on the money. So, we can see from this that even the Catholic Church isn't doing actual idolatry with the statues, even though they are still forbidden from the verses that specifically say not to make molten images.</p>
            <p>However,</p>
