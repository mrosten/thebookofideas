<p>The ethical system of the Duties of the Heart (which is the basis of the ethical system of Judaism) is almost identical to the system of Christian authors who were about 200 years before it. -(Those same authors provided the Islamic thinkers with their system also. However this isn't to say that Jews aren't creative or original, but their special power is that of integration -i.e. the welding together is disparate ideas to come out with a result where the whole is more and better than the parts.</p>
            <p>It is obvious that we see a case of the dialectics of Hegel, i.e., the Jewish people representing one principle and each non-Jewish nation representing another principle and their interacting to create a new synthesis which then further interacts. But the Kabbalah would explain it differently - that the non-Jewish nations have fallen from their higher root in Tohu [ which comes from the Divine Name of Numerical value 63] and need  to rise there and the Jewish people  need to draw that light of Tohu into their vessels.</p>
            <p>CONCLUSION Now science, I have been saying throughout this book, is on the level of understanding higher than any religion. However there also the degree of goodness is dependent on the closeness to the origin, not how high one can climb. This can however be the subject of debate. Some people may want to put Judaism at the top others Christianity others science and still others kabbalah. I don't want to enter that debate for I think it is irrelevant as to determine one's degree of good or evil or horizontal closeness with God. But it does determine vertical closeness.] [Now I have in this put all systems to the left of the y axis and said goodness refers to closeness to the axis. However it is possible that in fact the column of infinite light is in the exact center between good and evil, I tend to this that is the case and that is the reason secular People tend to be closer to God than religious. In the vertical order I think the vessels of evangelical Christianity are on foundation of Tohu (since they are from Tohu Chaos which is a higher level than the vessels of correction) But only if it stays pure for the higher something is if it falls, it falls lower than other things. The reason I think this is Jesus being a prelude to redemption contained a higher vessel than Judaism which remained one rung back. However in terms of the light, the light of correction-Torah is higher.] But since the correction involves taking the broken vessels of tohu and fixing them and</p>
