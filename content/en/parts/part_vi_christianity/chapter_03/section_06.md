### Creating One Large Vessel

...creating one large vessel it would make sense to do that with the different systems and then drawing into them the light of the **Name 45**—the Torah. Rabbi Nachman holds that the **Name 52** is a measure of the **entropy of the universe**. "Science" has come to pervade human thought. In the 1800s it undermined the authority of the Bible, and certainly of the Talmud. It also affected faith in that it became a **rival faith**. The objective achievements of "science" along with the weakness of Christianity to check violence, impressed the common man, and led him to believe in the new faith of "science". Respect for it grew in proportion to its achievements. "Science" has already pervaded every aspect of human life while religion has failed in its major objective of understanding the basic meaning of life.

### Science as Messiah

"Science" became a religion. It became the **messiah**. It was thought to provide answers for metaphysical questions and all social problems. (While philosophy became the proponent of the idea of the invalidity of all metaphysical questions.) It was thought to provide the standards to regulate human behavior. It has shaped, molded and formed all modern attitudes more pervasively than any religion. The elite of society were people with no apparent religious belief. It was thought that there was no question that science couldn't solve. Any religious belief in its path was obliterated.

<strong>The Number of the Beast</strong>
It is interesting to note the year Calculus was discovered: **1666**, and the year relativity was discovered on the Jewish calendar was **5,666**. And the Book of Revelation considers **666** to be the number of the Beast (i.e., Noga), and the Lekutai Moharan considers scientists to be the **Head of the Snake** (i.e., Kelipat Noga). So clearly Science needs to be connected to fear of God or it falls into evil.

### The Cooling of Fervor

Since the 1700's the number of scientists doubled every 15 years. Since the advent of the cold war and the threat of nuclear or chemical holocausts, the fervor for science has cooled off. Now it is pursued mainly for the purpose of making a living. However the effects of its dominance are still here. However, the **religion of "science and progress" has been debunked**. So people go back to different religions for the answers those religions just don't have. However I hope I have shown in this book a path by which it is possible to combine religion and science into a **cohesive organic whole** being capable of progress that each one individually wasn't able to do.

### The Indisputable Metaphysical

The existence of the **Metaphysical realm** is now an indisputable fact, if from the evidence of people like **Rabbi Israel Abuhatzeira** or Benny Hinn, the Christian evangelists or the miracle workers of India. Now to dispute the existence and validity of miracles is to maintain a faith that contradicts documented facts that have been and continue to be validated every day. I believe that the place where science and faith touch is the world of **math**, the lowest...
