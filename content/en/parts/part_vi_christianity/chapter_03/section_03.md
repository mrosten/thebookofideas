### The Energy Fields of Holiness

At first non-Jews had a soul from the outside of the **kelipah**—even their good inclination is from the kelipah. But when they began to believe in the **One God**, they drew a higher holiness on themselves from their higher root. This applies to non-Jewish nations as a whole also, for every nation is like a whole person with some people representing the head and some the hands and others the heart and others the soul.

### The Music of the Spheres

The reason God brought **Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart** was to create music that would tie one's soul to the higher Sefirah (divine trait). That is:
- **Bach** — Glory
- **Mozart** — Kindness  
- **Beethoven** — Judgment
- **Handel** — Royalty

Incidentally, Beethoven did intend his music to be specifically ethnic which for Germany and Austria is the trait of **judgment**, and it is only softened by the belief in Jesus. But after they threw out Jesus in the 1860s, the basic ethnic philosophy of Germany took its place, i.e., war and conquest.

### The Sabbath Field

The reason a non-Jew is not allowed to keep the Sabbath is that he is not affected by the **Shabbos-field energy**. Jews are affected only by the **straight Sefirot energy field**, and non-Jews are affected only by the **circular Sefirot field**.

Each one of the 10 Sefirot has its own energy field. There are certain Sefirot that draw wisdom or children etc. And there are combinations of the fields of the Sefirot that draw different combinations of blessings. A field is usually created or drawn by what one occupies himself with. So if one for instance learns math he will usually draw upon himself the **math field energy**. Kindness draws a kindness field. Learning Gemara brings its particular field energy. Evil has its energy also.

### The Electromagnetic Oscillation

A place or country has its energy. Every day has its own energy. The reason to be by **Rabbi Nachman on Rosh Hashanah** is there is a certain energy field around a tzadik and every special day has its own energy field. So on Rosh Hashanah when the two combine and there is created an **electromagnetic oscillation** by the presence of the Hasidim, and a spiritual electromagnetic wave is created.

<strong>Intuition of the Heart</strong>
Many times one can't help what type of field is drawn upon him or how he will be affected by it. He can just try his best to do what is right. But general principles can fail in specific situations and therefore God has given us a certain **intuition in the heart** to be able to detect energy fields not seen by the eye or detected by the mind.
