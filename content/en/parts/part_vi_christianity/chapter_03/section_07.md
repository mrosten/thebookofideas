### The Bridge of Mathematics

...Sefirah of the spiritual world and the top Sefirah of the physical world. And to show how there really is no contradiction between faith and science. But each must remember its proper place, and in what it is qualified to judge, and in what it is not. (Theoretically physics and the Torah predict their own limits.)

Also I hope I have shown the meaning of the Zohar that says **"God loves the Divine trait (Sefirah) of Royalty (Mathematics) so much, that he put the workings of His whole house into her hands, so that all the higher and lower worlds operate under her principles."**

### The Revolution of Two Sefirot

My final conclusion is that **ONE NEEDS FAITH AND REASON, MALCHUT AND CHOKHMAH.**

These two Sefirot need to **revolve around each other** and thus produce the energy needed to make a better world.
