### The Cultural Mirrors

It seems to me that the world points defined by place and time are only approximations as in **General Relativity**, and it's really only the properties of the **field around one** that determine his spirituality and closeness with God. As Rebbi said to Antoninus, **"Esau, but not all Esau"**, i.e., what the Torah says in general is only an approximation unless it says "all". Of course the idea of the mitzvot is to draw the field energy. Every family has its specific energy field around it.

There is a disagreement among the first authorities if the Jewish and gentile soul is the same thing. The other authorities say there is a difference in the souls and this opinion I have followed in this book since it is of **Rabbi Luria** also.

### The Parallel Paths

Thought in Judaism follows a **parallel path** to that of their neighbors (but they add a Jewish touch and talent to it), since non-Jews are from **Tohu** which is above **Tikun** which is the root of the Jewish people.

**Historical Examples:**
- After the Romans codified their laws in **Justinian's reign**, the Jews codified theirs in the same period.
- Since the western Catholic Church followed **rationalistic tendencies**, so did the Jews in western Europe and in Catholic lands like Poland and Lithuania. (The hard-headed rationalism of Jews from those areas is quite famous.)
- Since the split of the Roman Empire, Constantinople and the Eastern Church followed **mystical tendencies**, and subsequently when the Muslims took over that area they incorporated the same ideas in the Sufi.

And so we shouldn't be surprised to find **Sephardic Jewry** from Islamic lands and **Russian Jewry** (who lived in lands under the Eastern Church) having strong mystical tendencies. The **Kabbalah** originates in fact in Islamic Spain before it was conquered by the Christians.

### The Reformation Echo

When **Martin Luther** broke away from the church and said one needs only faith not reason, this same idea became the prevalent pattern in Western Jewry also until nowadays. The clear opinion of the authorities and even the great saints of Hasidut that one needs to combine **Faith and Reason** has been forgotten. **Rabbi Nachman** held Faith was the main thing, but he clearly held one needs reason also.

<strong>Cultural Absorption</strong>
Jewish music from Islamic lands is totally Arabic in character. The yeshivot are the Jewish version of the monastery, and this is why they only existed in Catholic lands, not in Russia (except a brief attempt before World War I), or in Islamic lands. Jewish music of European Jewry is almost an exact duplicate of Ukrainian music.
