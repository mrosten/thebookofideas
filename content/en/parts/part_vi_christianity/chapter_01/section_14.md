            <h4>The Soul and Its Garments</h4>
            <p>Jesus is accused of prioritizing good character above the commandments. Yet every major Sage of Israel affirms this hierarchy: the Chafetz Chayim writes that character comes first, citing "walk in His ways <em>and</em> keep His commandments"—the first mentioned takes precedence. The Kabbalist Rashash states that character is the soul itself, while mitzvot are merely its garments. The GRA echoes this throughout his writings.</p>

            <h4>Could The Sages Be Wrong About Jesus?</h4>
            <p>In Sanhedrin 104b, we learn that the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah—including the last three prophets—wanted to count King Solomon among those with no portion in the World to Come. Divine echoes eventually corrected them. The question arises: If this supreme council of prophecy could nearly err about Solomon, couldn't later Sages, lacking prophecy, have erred about Jesus?</p>

                        <p><strong>Historical Fact:</strong> The Anshei Keneset HaGedolah, which included Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi—the final prophets—initially judged King Solomon harshly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Divine Correction:</strong> God repeatedly sent "echoes" (Bat Kol) to indicate their error. Eventually, they changed their minds.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Implication:</strong> If this body—possessing both the chain of tradition <em>and</em> direct prophecy—could make a preliminary error of judgment, how much more so could post-prophetic Sages err in their assessments?</p>

                    <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
                        "God corrected the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah because of their greatness. But who says God would necessarily intervene for later sages?"

            <p>This principle—reconsidering received tradition in light of theological rigor—characterizes the entire thrust of this chapter. Jesus taught like the Sages on character priority, like the Gemara on handwashing, like Rashi on Shabbat practice. Perhaps the condemnation, formed in political tumult and incomplete Rabbinic authority, deserves the same reconsideration once given to Solomon.</p>
