<p>was saved’”. [This is the literal translation.] Later, the Prophet Hoshea said about this that God appeared to him and served him. [ Hoshea 12:3-6] Now, the sages have a different idea of what happened there, and said it referred to the angel of Esau — which really isn't a problem, for the simple explanation is that God contains all aspects good and evil for there is nothing besides him. Now, if that was God in human form, who we usually refer to as Jesus, it is in fact interesting that Jesus became the intercessor of Esau [Rome]. It is assumed in general that God refers in general to the aspect of God that is above all time and space, but also to each individual level that is one step  higher that the previous, which contains the light of God relative to that previous level.</p>
            <p>As the Sages said about the Tana who explained every Hebrew word ET in the Torah as a ribui — including something else — when he got to the verse that says, “‘ Et’ the Lord your God you shall fear”, he stopped. For what could that ET possibly include? Until Rabbi Akiva came and explained, “‘ Et the Lord your God you shall fear’, to include disciples of the wise.”] [This idea that God is each immediate higher level is actually hinted at in the Torah, where Abraham said to Avimelech, “the gods tricked me into leaving my father’s home” i.e., the set of all the spiritual levels up to God].</p>
            <p>I know that the two major themes of the Old Testament are that there is only One God and to Him alone it is proper to pray and serve. And the other being that the Jewish people are the chosen people forever and that this will never change. However, the idea that we need an intermediary is also there, from the blessings of the Patriarchs to the requests of the people to the prophets. Thus, I would like to suggest that the level to which no intermediary is necessary  is the level immediately above one called Elohim which is the set of all those levels. But to God as he is really is above time space and conception [that is represented by the ineffable Name], apparently we do need some help</p>
