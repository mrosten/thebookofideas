<p>because we don't know the exact first calculation for Rosh Chodesh [the new moon]. Thus if we did, we would take it in despite of the rabbinical decree of Rabbah, of ‘perhaps he will carry it four amot in a public domain’”. The Rif states the Gemara in Succah for the halacha, so he holds the same way. See the Ritvah in chapter 4 of Rosh Hashanah. The Greek word for picking corn also implies rubbing it between one’s fingers, which is permitted on the Shabbat. It just seems like Jesus and his disciples encountered on the Shabbat ultra-religious Jews who were ignorant of the halachah as happens all the time with people that are super religious — they always keep on adding restriction upon restriction. I have seen many times people doing perfectly permitted things on the Sabbath and getting  attacked by the ultra-orthodox, who simply didn't know the halachah — and even when the Shulchan Aruch [Code of Jewish Law] was brought out to show them, they wouldn't believe it.</p>

[Moreh NevuchimIII:27, 43] Couldn't it have been “ hora’at sha’ah ” [a need of the hour], as the Rambam explains about Eliyahu the prophet on Mount Carmel? For, to the Rambam Eliyahu didn't sacrifice there because he received a prophecy allowing it, rather because of the general principle of “ hora’at sha’ah ”.</p>
            <p>In the War Rule 5:1-5 of the Dead Sea Scrolls, according to the translation of Robert Eisenman and Schiffman it says, “as it is written in the Book of Isaiah the prophet”, “The thickets of the forest shall be hacked away with iron and the Lebanon trees in their majesty shall fall. But a shoot shall grow out of the stump of Jesse, [a twig shall sprout from his stoke [Isaiah 10:34 and 11:1] a shoot of David, and they will be judged, the... and the prince of the congregation will kill him, the army of… with drums and dances.
