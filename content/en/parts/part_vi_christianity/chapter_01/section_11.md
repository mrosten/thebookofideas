            <!-- "The Wrestling Match" -->
            <h4>The Wrestling of Chaos and Correction</h4>
            <p>Why do we need help? Because the pure Essence is beyond interaction. God Himself says of the angel sent before Israel: "Do not disobey him, for My Name is in him." Here, the intermediary is authorized by the Presence within him. This solves the conflict between Monotheism and Mediation.</p>
            
            <p>The Rambam, often embarrassed by the mystical or "irrational" elements of Torah (like God wrestling in human form), sought to sanitize theology. But the earlier Sages were unafraid of the paradox. Jacob wrestling with the "Man" was not a hallucination—it was a collision of World Orders.</p>

                        <strong>The Result:</strong> Jacob does not defeat the angel by destroying him, but by holding on until he extracts a blessing. This is the rectified response to Christianity/Edom: not to destroy the force of "God in the Flesh," but to extract the sparks of holiness from it and integrate them into the structure of Truth.

            <p>We wrestle with the "embarrassment" of Scripture—slavery, irrational commandments, divine anthropomorphism. But these are features, not bugs. They are the friction points where the Infinite grinds against the Finite to create the sparks of consciousness. The ultimate resolution is not the erasure of the "Other," but the harmonious integration of the "God of the Flesh" (Jesus/Edom) under the "God of the Spirit" (Torah/Jacob).</p>
