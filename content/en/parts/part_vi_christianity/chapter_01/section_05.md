            <p>(The reason the world of the Jew and gentile is connected solely by a black hole is that the circular sephirot were drawn out into the empty space, and then starting from the top again were drawn to the straight ones -- so basically, to get to them you would have to go through the singularity in the center -- (which from the aspect of the straight sephirot looks like the lowest one could sink to -- and it appears one stays there forever), and then come out the other end and enter into the circular sephirot, which is basically what Jesus did.</p>
            <p>The idea of God appearing as a person is mentioned in the Gemarah of Sannhedrin where it says God went into a physical body at the time of Nebuchadnezzar to give him a haircut (which most rabbis don't mention when arguing against the Trinity). So, theoretically there can be a world line of Moses, or any saint like so:</p>

            <p>So at any one period of time the soul of a tzadik can be viewed as either good or bad (an anti-particle), depending on where you met his world line (as the Zohar says, “The spirit of Moses is stretched out throughout all generations”, this means that the time-line of Moses is stretched out through all sephirot, which, to the Ramchal is the time-line. So, I really haven't added anything new here. A. One progressing with the world getting older. B. One getting younger. C. One the oldest is aging to the world outside having returned from the future.</p>
            <p>Since Jesus is united with the sepherah of Foundation which contains the light of Kindness, it is impossible to receive the light of Kindness without some direct or indirect connection with him. Even an unknown connection can draw that light (even if one just says he doesn't know) -- but a total denial of him seems to lead to wickedness. Jesus himself says that the Messiah can't be the son of David. This seems to imply in itself that he was the Messiah from Joseph who must precede Messiah son of David.</p>
            <p>God promised David that the Messiah would come from his male seed. And in general, the succession to the Crown is through the male seed as it says in Deut. 17:20, “so that he will have length of days in his rulership, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.” Jesus was descended from David only from his</p>
