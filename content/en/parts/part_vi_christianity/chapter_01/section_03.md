            <h4>The Savior's Requirement</h4>
            <p>A savior's effectiveness is contingent upon the people's belief. Just as Moses could only save the small fraction of Israel that believed in him—leaving the rest to perish in the darkness of Egypt—Jesus could not fulfill the national promises of building the Temple or gathering the exiles because his own people rejected him. The failure to achieve the national messianic goals was not a failure of the savior, but a failure of the "Vessels" (the people) to receive the Light. Had the teachings of peace been accepted, the hot-headed nationalism that led to the Temple's destruction might have been avoided.</p>

            <strong>The Change of Basis</strong>
            In the spiritual geometry of Emanation, the "Basis" of the Sepherah of Foundation was originally Joseph. With the advent of Jesus, a change of basis occurred—a new mapping where the four letters of Jesus's name (Yeshu) became the new vectors for the Light of Foundation. This was not a deletion of the old system, but a transformation of its manifold to allow for a broader outreach to the nations.
