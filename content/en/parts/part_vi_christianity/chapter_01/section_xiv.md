<p>in me.” And, in fact, his promise to bring that generation into Israel would have been a false prophecy if not for the two people of the generation that did believe in him all the way: Calev Ben Yefune and Hoshea Ben Nun. But at any rate God's purpose will not be thwarted totally, and we find with the introduction of the Magna Carta in the beginning of the 6th millennium when God did promise the redemption, that the yoke of the nations has slowly been lifted off Israel, who are now able to live in relative freedom compared to the chaos and suffering under the Romans and the Dark Ages.</p>
            <p>In fact, I think that it is possible that Shmuel was referring to messiah of Joseph and Rabbi Yochanan to the messiah from David. And, in fact this is hinted at by the Rambam who brings the statement of Shmuel also, so apparently, he felt that it is possible to reconcile those statements. This, however is not like the gemara which says openly that Rabbi Yochanan and Shmuel disagree. One of the other objections I have heard against Jesus is that his teachings disagree with that of the Sages: however I have found that not to be correct, e.g., Jesus held that a saint has the power to forgive sin as it says in masechta Rosh Hashanah 17b, God forgives the sin of many for the sake of the one and also we find, Moses prayed to God, “forgive their sin and if not, wipe me out of your book”.</p>

The Chafetz Chayim wrote in Shmirat HaLashon that good character comes first as it says in the verse, “To walk in his ways and to keep his commandments,” and he brings another statement from the sages, that the first thing a verse mentions is first in importance before the later thing — and, this verse specifically is referring to kindness and compassion. The Kabbalist Rashash says, along these lines in Nahar Shalom, that character is the basic soul of a person, while the commandments are only the garments of the soul. The Gra says things along these lines throughout his books.</p>
            <p>We find in Sanhedrin 104b, that the Anshei Keneset HaGedolah wanted to count King Solomon among those who have no portion in the next world. Different echoes came to indicate to them that they were wrong until eventually they changed their minds. My question is if this body of Sages which included the three last prophets could make a mistake about King Solomon, couldn't the later Sages of</p>
