            <!-- "The Servant of God" -->
            <h4>The Servant of God</h4>
            <p>Following the lineage paradox, it is crucial to clarify the nature of worship. Jesus quoted the Torah when tempted by the evil one, declaring: "The Lord Your God You shall fear and Him alone you shall serve." It seems clear that Jesus believed one must serve God alone, not Jesus himself. The Torah affirms, "There is nothing besides God." Coming to this knowledge of the oneness and uniqueness of God—loving Him, fearing Him, and keeping His commandments—is what the Torah defines as serving God.</p>

            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            "Because of the uncertainty principle, there will always be questions about Jesus or any saint that can't be answered."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Just as history leaves us with unanswered questions about the fall of Rome or the Crusades, faith leaves us with the "Uncertainty Principle of the Tzadik." If you believe in the Torah and the Talmud, you accept mysteries you cannot solve. This uncertainty is not a bug, but a feature of free will.</p>

            <h4>The Roman Redemption Paradox</h4>
            <p>The Gemara in <em>Avodah Zarah</em> (p. 9) makes a startling claim: one shouldn't buy land outside of Israel after 470 AD, because the Redemption will have already arrived. It also states the Messiah will come when the Roman Empire has spread over the whole world. At the time of the Gemara, the "world" was synonymous with the Persian Empire, yet the text specifies Rome. Since the Roman Empire as a political entity no longer exists, these prophecies seem to fail—unless they refer to the spiritual empire of Christianity (Edom) which indeed spread across the globe. By this reading, the "Roman Redemption" did arrive, in the form of the spreading of the knowledge of God through Christianity.</p>

            <p>The Sages say the grave of Moses was hidden so people wouldn't turn it into a shrine for immediate redemption. Similarly, the full nature of the Messiah remains hidden to prevent a premature collapse of the historical process. We are left with the work of clarification: sifting the sparks of truth from the four corners of the spiritual globe.</p>
