<p>One of the benefits of there being religious people even though they are jerks is that the gate into holiness would be closed by the klipot completely if they weren't standing in the door. So even though the religious are themselves an obstacle to the service of God still they benefit us by keeping the door open. There is a normal distribution of how many people [Jewish, Christian, etc] can or should be religious. This is because there are ten sephirot and the sepherah of piety is Judgment. The orthodox are Judgement, which is 10% of all Jews [However, a recent study shows the orthodox are about 7% of American Jews.] The Rashi that explains that people should not try to keep all the mitzvot [because if they would, then no one would merit to the next world] was written for those people who are not allowed to be religious, for being religious isn't their root and it is forbidden for them to try to be religious and it would hurt them spiritually if they would try.</p>
            <p>The Gemara in Macot 24A says, ‘Rabbi Simlai expounded: 613 commandments were said to Moses... [King] David came and established them on 11... Isaiah came and established them on 6... Micah came and established them on 3.... Isaiah then established them on 2... Amos came and established them on 1… Rashi writes, “[…] Established them on 11.” For, at first people were righteous and could bear the yoke of many commandments, but the later generations were not so righteous and if they would try to keep them all no one would merit. So, David came and established them on 11.” Rashi is clear. However, the other first authorities explain this Gemarah differently. Now, to show you that I am not making up my own explanation of Rashi, look at the Marsha who says on this Rashi, “the question is famous,” and then he brings the explanation of another first authority. However, this doesn't detract from the fact that Rashi wrote what he wrote. This does show however that even the Marsha understood Rashi as saying what it is obvious what he is saying.</p>
            <p>Isn't it clear that Rashi knew the verses of the Torah that say the Mitzvot are forever? Obviously, yes. So, we must say that Rashi held those verses apply only to the specific commandment that the verse is referring to there, e.g., if the Torah says the two loaves or the Shabbat are forever then we know that those mitzvot are eternal. But why doesn't it say this by other mitzvot? It must be that the other mitzvot are not eternal. [Otherwise, why say it by some and not others? And the verse in Haazinu [Deut. 29:28] says to do all the words of the Torah forever, but not to do mitzvot that were given only for a certain time period forever. For instance, if a person would sit in a sukkah on chanukah, he would not have a mitzvah. If you do a mitzvah after its time period is over, you also have no mitzvah. So, in Rashi's explanation, King David said the time to keep the mitzvot that were not eternal is over. But he was not referring to mitzvot like the Shabbat, which are. It seems to me that the Mitzvot mentioned in connection with the land of Israel are eternal since the Torah gives them in order that we should inherit the land of Israel forever.</p>
            <p>Now there is a difference of opinion if the commandments are a goal in themselves. If we take the Baal HaTanya's point of view, then one way to resolve that Rashi, except to say that the Baal HaTanya must hold like the other Rishonim that explain that Gemara differently. However, the perush on the Rambam explains that lower fear of God [fear of punishment] is to bring one to the mitzvot and the mitzvot are to bring one to the higher fear [awe of God]. According to this Rashi it comes out well. For since the commandments are specifically to bring one to awe of God and King David [and the later prophets] saw that in their generation the mitzvot did not cause awe of God. Perhaps that caused him to realize the time period was over.</p>
