<p>The Brit Menuchah mentions that Prophecy comes from the Tzitz of the Cohen Gadol which is representative of the sepherah of the crown and comes only through the path of judgment. And this helps to answer Nietzsche's objection to the saints of old that afflicted themselves to come to some spiritual levels. Rabbi Nachman also mentions this in Likutei Moharan, Vol. 1, Ch. 24, that the crown prevents the mind from reaching the infinite light, and thus by the hitting on the mind on the constraint of the crown are made vessels to receive the light. [It seems it works like a RLC circuit.]</p>
