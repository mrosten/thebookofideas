            <h4>The Thermodynamics of Joy</h4>
            <p>Happiness is the result of spiritual motion—either <strong>Upward</strong> or <strong>Inward</strong>. Just as in physics, there are conservation laws in the realm of the spirit.</p>
            <div class="justice-balance">
            <input type="radio" name="joy-thermo" id="joy-eq" class="balance-toggle" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="joy-thermo" id="joy-source" class="balance-toggle">
            <input type="radio" name="joy-thermo" id="joy-polarity" class="balance-toggle">
            <div class="balance-controls">
            <label for="joy-eq" class="balance-label label-righteous">Equilibrium</label>
            <label for="joy-source" class="balance-label label-righteous">The Source</label>
            <label for="joy-polarity" class="balance-label label-wicked">Polarity</label>
            </div>
            <div class="consequence-grid">
            <div class="consequence-box earth-box" style="grid-column: span 2;">
            <div id="view-eq">
            <h5>Social Equilibrium</h5>
            <p>Associating with unhappy people dissipates your own joy until you reach an equilibrium with them. Happiness flows like heat—from high concentration to low.</p>
            <span class="status-badge badge-reward">Leveling</span>
            </div>
            <div id="view-source" style="display:none">
            <h5>The Vertical Source</h5>
            <p>While you cannot "create" joy, you can draw it from the Divine through prayer and kindness. This bypasses horizontal equilibrium by tapping into the Ten Sephirot.</p>
            <span class="status-badge badge-reward">Inflow</span>
            </div>
            <div id="view-polarity" style="display:none">
            <h5>Global Polarity</h5>
            <p>Great pleasure often coincides with great pain to preserve the global balance. Every "vast" thing that enters mortality often brings its own shadow.</p>
            <span class="status-badge badge-punish">Shadow Light</span>

            </div> </div> </div>
            <script>
            document.querySelectorAll('input[name="joy-thermo"]').forEach(radio => {
            radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const views = ['eq', 'source', 'polarity'];
            views.forEach(v => {
            document.getElementById('view-' + v).style.display = document.getElementById('joy-' + v).checked ? 'block' : 'none';
            });
            });
            });
            </script>
            <h4>The Happiness Factor</h4>
            <p>Rabbi Nachman taught that "rejoicing in the Lord" is an constant duty. If you are unsure if a path is God's will, look at the <strong>Happiness Factor</strong>. If joy is present, it is a sign of Divine approval. This is because happiness is <em>Klipat Noga</em>—it can be elevated into holiness—whereas depression is purely of the <em>Klipot</em> (evil shells) and has no root in God.</p>
            <div class="concept-box">
            <strong>Failure as a Catalyst</strong>
            Sometimes, a "curse" is the necessary precursor to a vast blessing.
            <ul class="clean-list">
            <li><strong>Heisenberg:</strong> Failing his PhD exam on micro-resolution led him to develop the Uncertainty Principle.</li>
            <li><strong>The First Lady:</strong> A woman (Barbara Bush) once had her reputation ruined by false rumors, only for the subsequent defense to lead her to meet and marry a future President.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Judgments (unhappiness) often come from a higher source than simple blessings. When integrated through attachment to God, these judgments turn into the greatest inspirations. </div>
