            <h4>Needs vs. Wants</h4>
            <p>Aristotle held that there is only one "right plan" for a good life: to seek and acquire the things we truly <strong>need</strong>. Wants are often deceptive, but needs are always good. These include external needs of the body and internal needs of the mind (knowledge) and heart (love and self-esteem).</p>

            <strong>The Strange Spiral</strong>
            <div class="feature-image">
            <img src="../../../../images/strange_spiral.png" alt="The Strange Spiral of Needs Visual">
            </div>
            <p>Happiness is not a destination but a constant movement upward through a hierarchy of needs:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical Needs:</strong> Food, shelter, and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Needs:</strong> To love and be loved.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Needs:</strong> Knowledge and the skill of thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Needs:</strong> Knowledge of God and the infinite soul.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The needs of the body are finite, but the needs of the soul are infinite. Free will is the choice of where on this spiral to work at any given moment. </div>
            <h4>Tangled Hierarchies</h4>
            <p>Victor Frankl observed that "giving a man a <strong>reason</strong> to live" allows him to find the "how." This reason must be the right goal—the meeting of internal needs through virtue and habit.</p>

            <strong>Gödel and the Loop</strong>
            Any system that refers to itself (like the human mind) must be incomplete. This <strong>Strange Loop</strong> is not a flaw, but a driver toward higher levels of existence. As Hofstadter pointed out, the mind is a "Tangled Hierarchy" where causes propagate both upward and downward.
            </div>
            <p>The Torah provides the "good habits" and virtues needed to navigate this spiral without having to resolve every dilemma from scratch. It is the roadmap for the mind to reach the Absolute.</p>
