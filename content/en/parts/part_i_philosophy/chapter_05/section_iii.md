            <strong>The Politics of Happiness</strong>
            Living in a good society is necessary for personal fulfillment. However, the state cannot <em>make</em> people happy; it can only provide the conditions of <strong>Peace</strong> and <strong>Freedom</strong>.
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Equality:</strong> All should have an equal chance to advance, not just those favored by the bureaucracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Taking from one to give to another (outside of cases of misfortune) is a failure to treat equals as equals.</li>
            <li><strong>The Balance:</strong> A balanced system of judges is necessary to prevent a disenfranchised class from becoming "anti-morality" and destroying society.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></div></p>
            <h4>Beyond Freedom</h4>
            <p>Hegel saw history as the Spirit's quest for <strong>Freedom</strong> (corresponding to the Divine Name 63). The Torah, however, points to an even higher level: <strong>Attachment to God</strong> (the Name 72).</p>
            <div class="concept-box">
            <strong>The Names of Progress</strong>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Name 63 (Tohu/Tikun):</strong> Represents the integration of chaos and order into political freedom.</li>
            <li><strong>Name 72 (Chesed):</strong> Represents pure happiness and unity with the Infinite Source.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Marxism failed because it ignored the spiritual needs of the soul, assuming only material dialectics matter. But history proves that when physical needs are met, the soul's cry for God only grows louder. </div></p>
            <h4>Everything is God</h4>
            <p>The Master, the Baal Shem Tov, suggested that it is proper to desire physical beauty and music, for these act as bridges to the Divine. Rambam agreed, advising those with heavy hearts to surround themselves with "lovely forms" and melody. Since there is nothing besides God, every beautiful thing is a window into His presence.</p>
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            "There is no evil in the world at all... everything is a manifestation of the Divine service, as long as it is done with joy and integrated into the Light."
            </blockquote>
