<p>Idea - God is infinitely distant behind many screens To use the things scientists cannot explain to prove the existence of God is not the right approach, for what will be done when science gets around to explaining these things (as has happened many times before)? The only real proofs I have seen are Spinoza's and Descartes'. But it seems that God has removed His light from the Empty Space and the closer we come to proving Him the further He recedes. So we see that after God's existence is proved logically, Kant comes around and attacks the ability of logic to prove anything. And as we reveal His presence in the empty space that He has created the further into the background he recedes. He hides himself in an infinite series of hidings, i.e. first he hides and then he hides that hiding, so that you do not know that he is hidden, then he hides that hiding, so that you don't know that he is hiding that he is hiding the hiding etc.</p>

<p>This hiding refers to the mental universe of logic and also to the physical world where God is sometimes revealed by miracles. Yet He still hides Himself further after the miraculous action. The only place one can really find God is in one's heart, for God reveals himself inside the hiding place. Only by faith can one jump over the doubts and into knowledge. Regarding faith, mathematics itself is founded on faith. Von Neumann and Gödel proved the lack of a logical foundation for mathematics - disproving the basic thesis of Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. Whitehead held that a priori knowledge is possible, and the Principia Mathematica represents that belief. Von Neumann, however, disproved the premise that all math can be based on logic.</p>

<p>In the Lekutai Moharan, Rabbi Nachman hints at the Big Bang Theory. He equates the empty space with the lack of belief and says also that the more one knows God the more one realizes that they do not know. That adds up to the idea that the spiritual empty space is expanding. This would imply the same reality in the physical realm (i.e., the big bang). <sup>[2]</sup></p>
