<h2>The Receding God</h2>

<p>Some try to prove God's existence by pointing to what science <em>cannot</em> explain. This approach is fundamentally flawed. What happens when science eventually explains those mysteries? (As it has done countless times before.)</p>

<p>The only robust proofs are those of <strong>Spinoza</strong> and <strong>Descartes</strong>—proofs that rest on logic itself, not on gaps in knowledge.</p>

<div class="concept-box prominent">
    <h3>The Paradox of Divine Retreat</h3>
    <p>God has removed His light from the <strong>Empty Space</strong>. The closer we come to proving Him, the further He recedes:</p>
    <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Spinoza proves God's existence logically.</li>
        <li>Then Kant attacks the very ability of logic to prove anything.</li>
        <li>We reveal His presence, and He withdraws further into the background.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Faith as Foundation</h3>

<p>This hiding occurs both in the <strong>mental universe</strong> of logic and in the <strong>physical world</strong>, where God sometimes reveals Himself through miracles—yet withdraws deeper into hiddenness after each revelation.</p>

<p>The only place to truly find God is in one's <strong>heart</strong>. He reveals Himself <em>inside</em> the hiding place. Only through faith can one leap over the doubts into knowledge.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
    <h3>Mathematics Itself Rests on Faith</h3>
    <p><strong>Von Neumann</strong> and <strong>Gödel</strong> proved that mathematics has no purely logical foundation—disproving Russell and Whitehead's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. Whitehead believed <em>a priori</em> knowledge was possible, but Von Neumann demonstrated that not all mathematics can be reduced to logic.</p>
    <p>And yet, remarkably, even though Gödel proved that every closed system must be incomplete, he himself constructed a proof of God's existence—demonstrating that incompleteness does not mean impossibility.</p>
</div>

<h3>Rabbi Nachman and the Big Bang</h3>

<p>In the <em>Likutey Moharan</em>, <strong>Rabbi Nachman of Breslov</strong> hints at what modern cosmology calls the Big Bang. He equates the "empty space" (<em>chalal hapanui</em>) with the absence of belief and observes that the more one knows God, the more one realizes how little one knows.</p>

<p>This leads to a profound insight: the <strong>spiritual empty space is expanding</strong>. If the spiritual realm expands with knowledge, perhaps the physical realm does the same—an expanding universe, born from an initial point of infinite density and divine withdrawal.</p>
