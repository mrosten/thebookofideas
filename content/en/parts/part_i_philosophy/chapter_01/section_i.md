<strong>The Paradox of Infinity</strong>
<div class="feature-image">
<img src="../../../../images/paradox_of_infinity.png" alt="The Paradox of Infinity Diagram">
</div>
<p>Rabbi Eliyahu, the Gaon of Vilna, taught two fundamental truths about God that must be held simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>He is infinitely great and beyond our understanding.</li>
<li>He is infinitely close to us.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Because of this, no matter how close we try to get to God, there are always endless dimensions to traverse. How much closer to infinity is a hundred than one? Not much. If we spend our lives approaching God from the aspect of His infinite distance, we remain far. But if we approach Him from the aspect of His infinite closeness, we find Him immediately.</p>

<p>Since God is both infinitely close and far at once (an incomprehensible paradox), the only place one can truly find God is in one's heart, where one <em>feels</em> God.</p>

<p>There is a force in the world called God. All forces are included in Him, but He is distinct from the forces of nature. We can perceive three aspects:</p>
<ul class="clean-list">
<li>The spiritual level immediately above every individual level.</li>
<li>The spiritual level that is inward (immanent).</li>
<li>God as He really is — infinitely above and beyond everything (transcendent).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="fancy-quote">
"He hides himself in an infinite series of hidings... so that you do not know that he is hidden."
</blockquote>

<p>This hiding permeates the mental universe of logic and the physical world. God is sometimes revealed by miracles (splitting the Red Sea), but often He recedes further into the background after the miracle. He objects to being demanded. Trust is the key, but it must be a trust strong enough to balance out one's deficiencies.</p>

<strong>Circular vs. Straight Sephirot</strong>
The idea that "nothing exists besides God" is on the level of the <strong>Circular Sephirot</strong> (He surrounds all worlds). But on the level of the <strong>Straight Sephirot</strong> (He fills all worlds), His life energy is divided among the different levels of creation.
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sparks:</strong> Keep things existing on a manifest level.</li>
<li><strong>The Life Force:</strong> Gives things their individual character.</li>
</ul>
