    <h3>The Paradox of Infinity</h3>
    <div class="feature-image">
        <img src="../../../../assets/images/paradox_of_infinity_diagram.png" alt="Paradox of Infinity Diagram" class="generated-art">
    </div>
    <p>Rabbi Eliyahu, the <strong>Gaon of Vilna</strong>, taught two fundamental truths about God that must be held simultaneously:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>He is <strong>infinitely great</strong> and beyond our understanding.</li>
        <li>He is <strong>infinitely close</strong> to us.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h3>Approaching the Infinite</h3>

<p>Because of this paradox, no matter how close we try to get to God, there are always endless dimensions to traverse. How much closer to infinity is a hundred than one? <strong>Not much.</strong></p>

<p>If we spend our lives approaching God from the aspect of His <em>infinite distance</em>, we remain far. But if we approach Him from the aspect of His <em>infinite closeness</em>, we find Him immediately.</p>

<p>Since God is both infinitely close and far at once (an incomprehensible paradox), the only place one can truly find God is in one's heart, where one <strong>feels</strong> God.</p>

<h3>Three Aspects of Divinity</h3>

<p>There is a force in the world called God. All forces are included in Him, but He is distinct from the forces of nature. We can perceive three aspects:</p>
<ul class="clean-list">
    <li>The spiritual level immediately above every individual level.</li>
    <li>The spiritual level that is inward (<strong>Immanent</strong> / <em>Memale Kol Almin</em>).</li>
    <li>God as He really is — infinitely above and beyond everything (<strong>Transcendent</strong> / <em>Sovev Kol Almin</em>).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="fancy-quote">
    "He hides himself in an infinite series of hidings... so that you do not know that he is hidden."
</blockquote>

<p>This hiding permeates the mental universe of logic and the physical world. God is sometimes revealed by miracles (like splitting the Red Sea), but often He recedes further into the background after the miracle. He objects to being demanded. <strong>Trust</strong> is the key, but it must be a trust strong enough to balance out one's deficiencies.</p>
