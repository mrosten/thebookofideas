<h4>The Gifts of Abraham</h4>
            <p>When Abraham sent his children to the East with "presents," he was giving them the seeds of Vedic knowledge. The arrival of the Vedic people in India (circa 1700–1500 BC) coincided with this period, bringing a monotheistic rejuvenation to the Indus-Saraswati civilization.</p>

            <strong>The Root of Meditation</strong>
            While the West focused on objective action, the East preserved the "presents" of Abraham—the deep principles of meditation and the search for enlightenment. Even today, the <em>Vedas</em> represent some of the most spiritual texts in existence, refusing to accept anything less than direct experience of the Divine.

            <h4>The Vertical Progression</h4>
            <p>Progress in the world is both horizontal (adding a base of knowledge) and vertical (ascending to new levels). Each field of study corresponds to a specific period of human history and a level of the soul.</p>

            <strong>The Final Renewal</strong>
            The Talmud suggests a massive transition in the year 6000 (2240 CE). Whether through spacecraft ("flying on wings") or biological renewal, mankind is destined for a transition from the world of labor to the world of rest—the return to the Source of all happiness.
