            <h4>The Direction of History</h4>
            <p>History is not a linear drift, but a purposeful progression. Mankind drifted "downward" from the heights of direct revelation until hitting the <strong>Origin</strong>. At that point, the trajectory reversed—we are now progressing back towards the Light from the other side.</p>

            <strong>The Millennium Flow</strong>
            Wisdom and Prophecy flow in cycles corresponding to the Hebrew calendar:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>6th Millennium (1240–2240 CE):</strong> The era of <em>Foundation</em> (Yesod). This explains the vast outpouring of wisdom and the Rambam’s prediction of the return of prophecy.</li>
            <li><strong>7th Millennium (Starts 2240 CE):</strong> The era of the "Sabbath," drawing from the infinite light of the future.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Cycles of Redemption</h4>
            <p>Every hundred years, a different field of human endeavor receives a special blessing of "overflowing" wisdom. This is the art-religion-science-philosophy cycle.</p>

            <strong>The Jewish Millennial Map</strong>
            The Jewish spiritual experience follows its own 100-year periods, starting on the 40-year marks:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>1240–1340 (Royalty):</strong> The rise of the Kabbalists (Abulafia).</li>
            <li><strong>1340–1440 (Foundation):</strong> Establishing the roots of faith.</li>
            <li><strong>1440–1540 (Splendor):</strong> A time of Judgment (Expulsion from Spain).</li>
            <li><strong>1540–1640 (Victory):</strong> The perfection of Kabbalah (The Arizal) and the proofs of God (Spinoza).</li>
            <li><strong>1640–1740 (Beauty):</strong> The golden age of Torah (Baal Shem Tov, the Gra, the Ramchal).</li>
            <li><strong>1740–1840 (Judgment):</strong> Falling away from Torah, met by the counter-force of Rabbi Nachman.</li>
            <li><strong>1840–1940 (Kindness):</strong> The Return to Israel and the American Foundation.</li>
            <li><strong>1940–2040 (Understanding):</strong> The Holocaust, the quest for Freedom (the 60s), and the awakening of new Judgments.</li>
