<h2>Chapter 7: Eras Of Man</h2>
            <p>The Talmud says that in the year 6000 (2240 in the English calendar) God will destroy the world, people will fly on wings 1000 years and then in the year 7000 there will be the revival of the dead and a renewal of this world. Perhaps the wings the Talmud refers to are spacecraft? [Is it possible we will live on other planets? I have heard that perhaps travel faster than light is possible if done like the traveling of energy in a rope that isn’t shaken up and down so that the energy travels in waves but rather pulled so that the energy travels in a faster way.] People haven't traveled back to us in time yet because to the Shemita opinion time comes in layers and the future layers haven't come yet into existence (the future doesn't yet exist.) Mankind goes through harmonic motion (something like</p>

            <p>). Similarly, each nation and individual. That is why this century has had accelerated harmonic motion with the progress of democracy and freedom; yet also world wars and depressions. I would suggest that A isn't a constant but gets smaller with time, so the harmonic motion gets more accentuated. I don't think accepting Jesus would have saved the Jewish nation at the second Temple period because if so, it should have done so for the Roman empire 300 years later. Yet we see the Roman Empire disintegrated into nothing starting immediately after they accepted Jesus. Thus, it seems to me that the events surrounding Jesus were as planned. According to the translation of Wise and Eisen that is in fact exactly what the prophet Isaiah if fact predicted. But it is likely that the destruction would have taken a less violent turn - as with the Romans the destruction of the nation meant dissolving the political unity, not the mass destruction of the people as it did for the Jewish people at the time of the destruction of the Temple.</p>
            <p>If we go by Hegel’s idea of religion and philosophy, I think we should be entering on a new age of religion that will be an improvement from the last ages for this coming one will include each religion retaining its identity yet integrating the good aspects of others.</p>
