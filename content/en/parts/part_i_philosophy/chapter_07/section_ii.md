<h4>The Spirit of the 1960s</h4>
            <p>The 1960s represented a massive shift in wisdom—an understanding that the existing establishment needed reformation. However, this rebellion often lacked a solid foundation. To prevent future "1960s" from decaying into apathy or fanatical rebellion, we need a synthesis of the world's greatest spiritual and philosophical roots: the Bible, the Talmud, Buddha, Jesus, and Rabbi Nachman.</p>

            <strong>The Shaking of the System</strong>
            The hippies served a crucial role: they shook the system so that internal reforms could take place. Without them, the Cold War might never have de-escalated. Their educational reforms shifted focus towards the individual, proving that even "chaos" can have a restorative function.

            <h4>Exiled Wisdom</h4>
            <p>At the destruction of the First Temple, the secrets of the Torah were scattered. This "spiritual Diaspora" explains the sudden emergence of intellectual giants like Pythagoras, Buddha, Plato, and Socrates—each carrying a spark of the original revelation to different corners of the world.</p>

            <h4>The Harmonic Motion of Man</h4>
            <p>Mankind’s progress follows a <strong>Harmonic Motion</strong>. This century has seen accelerated movement toward democracy and freedom, yet simultaneously faced the lowest depths of world wars and depressions. This oscillation is part of the soul's refinement as it approaches the final equilibrium.</p>
