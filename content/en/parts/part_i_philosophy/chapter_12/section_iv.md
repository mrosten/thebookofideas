<p>Learning to know who to trust among people also is an important skill. For money management is a skill which is like any other skill. Some are good at it and others are not. For those who are not it is important to at least tell who you can trust in your monetary affairs. Or in other personal decisions, many times the nearest and dearest to us advise things based on their own hatreds and prejudices without our own interest in mind. Someone close to me was advised by people he trusted to leave me and found himself in a whole lot of trouble for several years.</p>
            <p>I myself trusted rabbis more than my parents and have found myself years later striped of my wife and children and no means of making an honest living except what I learnt from my parents. Leonardo De Vinci thought people are meant to live balanced lives. It is true that each person has a special area of talent, but each person should try to be balanced by doing physical activity every day and learning different subjects. I think in the way that God made us that we can only do so much of any one thing and then we need to go on and the next day we can come back to it.</p>
            <p>Thus, in values also. Though on the surface it might seem there are different duties a person must do, and they conflict, I think in fact there is no conflict for somehow only one of the options is the right one and the task is to choose the right one. Leonardo himself developed different aspects of his personality in science and art and physical activity. They say he was so strong that he could crush nuts in his hand. Here is something to bear in mind as you go through life from the author Herodotus: The exceeding good fortune of Polycrates did not escape the notice of Amasis, who was much disturbed thereat. When therefore his successes continued increasing, Amasis wrote him the following letter, and sent it to Samos. “Amasis to Polycrates thus sayeth: It is a pleasure to hear of a friend and ally prospering, but thy exceeding prosperity does not cause me joy, forasmuch as I know that the gods are envious. My wish for myself and for those whom I love is to be now successful, and now to meet with a check; thus, passing through life amid alternate good and ill, rather than with perpetual good fortune. For never yet did I hear tell of anyone succeeding in all his undertakings, who did not meet with calamity at last, and come to utter ruin. Now, therefore, give ear to my words, and meet thy good luck in this way: bethink thee which of all thy treasures thou valuest most and canst least bear to part with; take it, whatsoever it be, and throw it away, so that it may be sure never to come any</p>
