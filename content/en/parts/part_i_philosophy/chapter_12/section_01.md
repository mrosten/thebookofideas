<h4>The Strategy of Decision</h4>

<div class="concept-box">
    <strong>The Four Pillars of Decision Making</strong>
    <p>When faced with the unknown, one must have a strategy.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Know Yourself:</strong> Understand your lack and your strength. As the Greeks said, "Know Thyself."</li>
        <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Like Col. Simons, never go in blind. "Find Out."</li>
        <li><strong>Situational Awareness:</strong> Like a fighter pilot, be aware of the whole sphere, not just the front.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Waiting:</strong> Putting oneself in God's hands does not mean sleeping; it means doing nothing until the clear will of God appears.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>Trust in God and simplicity. If you don't know something, it is because <em>Vesikin Vesikin</em>—God doesn't want you to know yet. To trust in God means learning to live with doubt until He solves the problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Rules of Engagement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Confirmation:</strong> Verify what you hear from a source other than yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Be Prepared:</strong> Like the Boy Scouts. When I went to Ukraine, I was told to take a sleeping bag. I thought it foolish for an indoor trip, but it saved me from freezing.</li>
<li><strong>The Ignatius Principle:</strong> “In time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm... in the resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding.” (St. Ignatius of Loyola).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On Advice:</strong> Never make a life decision under pressure, emotional need, or sexual desire. Find a way to relax—Winston Churchill made his major WWII decisions in the bathtub! Be wary of the "good advice" of others, even Rabbis, if it diminishes your free will. We saw in the Holocaust that relying on authority figures sometimes led to inaction. Retain your agency.</p>

“There is such a thing as putting oneself in God's hands. It is not seeking advice from dreams, angels, or intuition. It is actively doing nothing until that very second that God makes one know.”
