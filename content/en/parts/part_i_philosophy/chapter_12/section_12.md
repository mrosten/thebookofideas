<p>group for a reason. All you can do is to go into detail in order to help person be careful if and when the warning signs do arrive. She went to gehinom to sing praises to God. As for myself, I have avoided evil. This is based a lot on the sages that say not to start up with evil people. I admire Barbara’s approach, but she always suffered afterwards. After she had been through some confrontation I would go to her apartment and let me tell you — she was so wiped out she literally couldn't move to clean a thing, this is a person who is usually clean to the n th degree.</p>
            <p>The stoics held that there is nothing between good and evil, virtue and sin. Either one is totally good or totally evil. This point of view is helpful in considering whether to marry someone. Instead of the customary point of view of looking at everyone as having some good and some bad, consider that they are one or the other and try to decide. This is in fact the Torah point-of-view since to the Rambam, when one is mostly good the evil is nullified. So, you really only end up with people that are totally one or the other.</p>
            <p>Now one problem in the religious world is that objective good and evil get mixed up with ritual. Religious people tend to judge virtue based on how one is in some rituals. But on the other hand, the good thing about torah is that it teaches that there is an objective good and evil. This, however, in recent years, has ceased to be so — in that the religious now tend to believe in moral relativism but still hide in religious looking clothing. There is such a thing as putting oneself in God's hands. It is not the same as doing nothing. Nor is it seeking advice from dreams, angels, saints or even one's own intuition. It is actively doing nothing until that very second that God makes one know.</p>
            <p>The advice that occurs to one when he has gone out into a field to ask God advice is many times different than what he thinks to himself in his usual environment [even when he prays in his normal environment]. The question is which of these to follow. It seems to me that neither is wrong but that that which is received outdoors in seclusion is better. The subject of advice which comes to one suddenly is subject to a debate between Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yisrael of Koznitz. Rabbi Yisrael said, a mitzvah that comes suddenly is usually from the evil side. Rabbi Nachman, in the story of the Simpleton, has the simple one getting a message from heaven and immediately dropping everything to follow it.</p>
            <p>Avoid court-holders [the type you find at every party]. Everyone gathers around them clinging to their every word of “wisdom”. They are invariably those who know nothing — this includes this includes rabbis.</p>
