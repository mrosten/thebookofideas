            <strong>The Rules of Spiritual Combat</strong>
            Life is a combat zone. During the process of "regeneration" (spiritual growth), one is constantly engaged in battle against old habits ("cupidities") and false beliefs.
            </div>
            <p>Swedenborg writes: "In the course of regeneration... man is continually engaged in combat... evil spirits are suffered to continue with him for a long time, that they may excite his cupidities, and that these may thus be loosened." But one is not alone: "Unless the Lord defended man every moment... he would instantly perish." <strong>Confrontation vs. Avoidance</strong> I had a friend, Barbara, who never minded confronting evil head-on. She would warn people in detail. But nearly every time, she suffered for it—wiped out, unable to move. I have tended to avoid evil, following the Sages' advice not to "start up" with the wicked. Both paths have risks.</p>
            <p><em>   <strong>The Thucydides Principle:</strong> Sometimes, retreat is the only sane option. As Phrynichus said after the disaster in Sicily, "It was no disgrace for an Athenian fleet to retreat when it suited them... it would be more disgraceful to be beaten." </em>   If you sense something is wrong, <strong>head on out of there.</strong> <strong>Slander and Forgiveness</strong> The more you hate someone, the more you must guard your tongue. If you slander them, you lose your portion in the World to Come and transfer your good deeds to them! <em>   <strong>The Most Powerful Prayer:</strong> Name those who have hurt you and explicitly release them from guilt. This frees </em>you* more than them.</p>
            <p>*   <strong>The Evil Eye:</strong> I am sensitive to it. But instead of being crushed by an ugly glance, I try to see if there is a kernel of truth in their negativity that I can use to correct myself. <strong>Stoic Clarity</strong> The Stoics held that there is nothing between Good and Evil. In deciding whether to marry or partner with someone, this binary view can be helpful: Are they Good or Bad? The Rambam agrees: if one is mostly good, the evil is nullified. But if they are bad, stay away. Avoid "Court-Holders"—those who gather crowds at parties to dispense shallow wisdom. They invariably know nothing.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> Look at every obstacle as a hint to change direction. It is not always a virtue to oppose evil; sometimes you just need to outmaneuver it. And above all, avoid the "experts" who lack common sense, and trust in the simple, direct guidance of the Creator.</p>
