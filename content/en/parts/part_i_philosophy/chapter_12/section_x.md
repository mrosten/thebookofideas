<p>The more you hate someone, the more you need not say anything negative about them - for afterwards how will you ask them for forgiveness? For the sin of slander, one loses his entire portion in the Future World. So, without that forgiveness, one is in deep trouble. This is besides the fact that all one's good deeds go to the one slandered. So, despite the fact that these motivations are selfish, it still is worthwhile not to lose your eternity. The most powerful prayer you can say is to name those that have hurt you and release them from guilt.</p>
            <p>I am afraid of the evil eye and try to avoid it. I am ultra-sensitive and hurt when people stare at me or give me ugly glances. But I believe that this in itself is sometimes a gift from God and a cause for blessing: but I don't treat every insult as a complement. Rather I try to see if perhaps there may be some element of truth in what the other person is saying. And despite the fact that they intend only to hurt me, I don't look at the intention but at what in me needs correcting. I have heard that women are uniquely sensitive about their bodies. Because of this it is proper that sex should be as wild as possible, to relax the woman. There is a hierarchy of principles in the Torah. Kindness is the highest principle (to Rabeynu Yerucham of the Mir Yeshiva in Poland). I think attachment to God is the highest principle, but that kindness is the main way to come to that.</p>
            <p>So, despite the fact that the Shulchan Aruch advises much restraint in sex, I think this was not meant in a case where the female needs to be encouraged to let go, in order that she should come to a state of relaxation and a feeling of well-being. The greatest kindness is to give to another person that which they need. Everyone needs to feel good about themselves. I think even bad people need to feel good to repent. Bad people don’t repent usually just because they don't feel good. However, Rabbi Nachman says differently. He says at once when one decides to repent, it is a sin to be depressed, i.e., before that one should be depressed in order to come to repentance. But this doesn't mean what we call depression, rather it means a low spirit.</p>
            <p>There is a problem being accepted as a well-liked member of a community or a leader: this brings down a person to the level of the people and tends to rid one of free will and free thought. So, it is necessary to have friends that will criticize you. Anyway, don't get semicha, and don't be a rabbi. The problems are pride, and lack of free will, after one is accepted. Also, it was taken for granted, in</p>
