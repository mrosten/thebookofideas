<p>more into the sight of man. Then, if thy good fortune be not thenceforth checkered with ill, save thyself from harm by again doing as I have counselled.” Equilibrium is a major principle in life. What one does to improve his situation invariably changes the balance. One can't foresee the consequences of that change. But if the situation one is in is in any way livable, then to change it is probably a mistake. Moving from one place to another changes a balance and should never be done unless absolutely necessary. Also, in every person there is a balance of talent. If smart in one thing invariably he will be foolish in another. The most talented of people tend to lack simple common sense I have become convinced that most people tend to be the exact opposite of what they appear.</p>

This is why the Jewish people when they came to America instinctively worked like dogs to make sure their children would get a college education.

You MUST take a sleeping bag." [I see now how wise that was. For I thought I was going to a place that was heated. Then when I left and found myself here in another place, I needed to wear several shirts, a sweater, a jacket, then to go into the sleeping bag and then put two woolen blankets over myself. All this is indoors. And this winter is mild. I remember winters when one could literally not go outside for more than two minutes.] My feeling is that this relates to the motto of the Boy Scouts, “Be Prepared.” For to be prepared for everything is impossible. And obviously I could not take everything I needed.</p>
            <p>But the idea is first: 1. Take as little as possible. 2. In the extra space left take small things that don't take</p>
