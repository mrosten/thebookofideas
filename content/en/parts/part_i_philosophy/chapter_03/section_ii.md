            <strong>The Mechanics of Holiness</strong>
            God created free will so man could choose God—uniting with Him through deeds, thoughts, and desires.
            <ul>
            <li><strong>The Free Handout:</strong> Receiving without earning is the level of <em>Royalty</em> (Malchut), which by nature must receive.</li>
            <li><strong>The Unity:</strong> Choosing God unites Royalty with the higher trait of Giving.</li>
            <li><strong>Union:</strong> When one is united with God, one can create Godliness. This is the inner meaning of the 1st Commandment: "Be fruitful and multiply"—in children, ideas, and music.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></div></p>
            <h4>The Alchemy of Intent</h4>
            <p>Pleasure exists on the level of the <strong>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong>. It is neutral by nature, acting as a raw energy that is shaped entirely by the vessel of the human heart. When intent is absent, pleasure remains static; when intent is holy, the sparks within the pleasure ignite and ascend.</p>
            <div class="justice-balance">
            <input type="radio" name="pleasure-path" id="view-trap" class="balance-toggle" checked>
            <input type="radio" name="pleasure-path" id="view-uplift" class="balance-toggle">
            <div class="balance-controls">
            <label for="view-trap" class="balance-label label-righteous">Autonomous Desire</label>
            <label for="view-uplift" class="balance-label label-righteous">Sacred Intent</label>
            </div>
            <div class="consequence-grid">
            <div class="consequence-box earth-box" style="grid-column: span 2;">
            <div id="panel-trap">
            <h5>The Trap of the Self</h5>
            <p>Pleasure for the sake of pleasure remains on its original level. Without upward momentum, it falls into the realm of the ego, becoming a closed loop that eventually leads to a sense of lack and spiritual darkness.</p>
            <span class="status-badge badge-reward">Falling Light</span>
            </div>
            <div id="panel-uplift" style="display:none">
            <h5>The Ascent of Sparks</h5>
            <p>By using pleasure as a tool for service (e.g., eating for vitality to do kindness), the "sparks" of holiness within the physical act are released. The evil shell falls away, and the act becomes a living sacrifice.</p>
            <span class="status-badge badge-reward">Elevated Essence</span>
            </div>
            <p></div> </div> </div></p>
            <script>
            document.querySelectorAll('input[name="pleasure-path"]').forEach(radio => {
            radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const isUplift = document.getElementById('view-uplift').checked;
            document.getElementById('panel-uplift').style.display = isUplift ? 'block' : 'none';
            document.getElementById('panel-trap').style.display = isUplift ? 'none' : 'block';
            });
            });
            </script>
            <h4>Reason, Revelation, and Freedom</h4>
            <p>Free thought needs room to flow. Yet, like a river, it requires banks to guide it toward the ocean of truth. Logic and Revelation are the two "outer vessels" that contain and protect free thought, corresponding to the highest levels of the soul.</p>
            <div class="concept-grid" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5rem;">
            <div class="concept-box">
            <strong>The Boundary of Logic</strong>
            In its purest form, logic provides the rigid structure necessary for understanding, yet it can limit the soul if it becomes a prison of the calculable.
            </div>
            <div class="concept-box">
            <strong>The Boundary of Revelation</strong>
            Revelation reveals truths beyond human reach. It guides thought toward the infinite (Yechida), setting a boundary where human reasoning meets Divine Light.
