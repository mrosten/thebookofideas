<p>This is based on the Ramchal, together with the beginning of the Eitz Chayim, and the Lekutei Moharan — but with a bit of integration. The idea is: God fills all worlds and surrounds all worlds — so one must unite the sparks of holiness in everything with the infinite presence of God himself by choosing God in everything he does, says, or thinks, or desires — and thus uniting himself and all creation with God. When one is united with God than he too can create Godliness, and this is the 1st commandment in the Torah of being fruitful and to multiply, and children and ideas, and music.</p>
            <p>The contradiction between absolute knowledge and free-will is that God knows what one will choose not just from the future but from now (i.e. not just because He knows the future). This contradiction is the root of Quantum Mechanics. Ideas are wave functions that travel at the speed of light and have all the characteristics of a quantum wave. That's why it's important not to think about your enemies badly so that your and theirs wave function doesn't mutually interfere and just darkness is left. Don't send your waves in that direction at all, for their waves can't bother yours at all unless you do.</p>
