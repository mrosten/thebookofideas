            <p>The contradiction between Absolute Knowledge (God knows everything) and Free Will is the root of <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave Functions:</strong> Ideas travel as wave functions. Negative thoughts about others create interference patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>The Uncertainty Principle:</strong> This principle applies to all aspects of life. It is the root of Free Will—the tension between thinking for oneself and listening to sages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></div></p>
            <h4>Revolving Systems</h4>
            <p>Ideas rotating around a common axis generate "rest energy" and "energy of motion."</p>
            <ul class="clean-list">
            <li><strong>Spinoza:</strong> Took basic axioms and revolved them to create a system with high "energy of motion" (the philosophy itself).</li>
            <li><strong>Madregat HaAdam:</strong> Built on one idea (Trust) without rotation around a complex axis. It created a mass movement (rest energy) but dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>The Bible &amp; Jesus:</strong> A valid revolving system based on God and the 13 Axioms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Architecture of Ideas</h4>
            <p>God created the world with <strong>Chaos (Name 63)</strong> and <strong>Order (Name 45)</strong>. The purpose of creation is to integrate them into <strong>Name 72</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            To understand an idea, one cannot just examine it pedantically. One must be "one with the idea."
            <br><br>
            "The bricks of the universe are beauty, and its blueprint is God. Beauty is the substance and God is the concept."
