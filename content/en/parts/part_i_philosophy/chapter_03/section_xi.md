<p>One can combine two points of view into one by considering the combination of each point in the first and the second and drawing a line through each of them into the new space of the name 45. This is in the straight sephirot and the same can be done in the circular sephirot. The uncertainty principle applies to all aspects of life and is the root of free will. For instance the conflict between freedom of thought (thinking for yourself) and listening to the wise. We find in the Torah itself this conflict, for even though we are supposed to listen to the Sanhedrin, still there is a whole section of the Torah which describes the types of sacrifice which must be brought when the Sanhedrin makes a mistake. And the Sages say that if one knew they were wrong, yet still acted on their opinion, he is responsible for his own actions.</p>
            <p>Ideas rotating around a common axis will give off its rest energy and energy of motion in the form of idea waves. That is the power of the works of philosophy of Spinoza who takes a few basic axioms and revolves them around each other until a whole work evolves out of it - which represents the energy of motion - for after Spinoza was done, the idea's implications of the axioms were fixed in idea space. However, the rest energy continues to affect a larger circumference of people. The book Madregat HaAdam created a vast mass movement but disappeared in one generation. This was because it was built on one idea alone (absolute trust in God) which is a great idea but doesn't give off much energy since it rotates on its own axis, not around another major idea.</p>
            <p>That is the same problem with Rav Shik's books based only on the principle that nothing exists besides God which is also good but again nothing comes of it because it is only one axiom. (Most Christian books I've seen have the same problem except for Thomas Aquines, who basically does the same thing as Spinoza.)</p>
