<p>Rabbi Nachman creates in every individual chapter a revolving system, and all the systems revolve around a common set of basic axioms. I believe that the Bible and Jesus represent one revolving system (on one axis God, and the basic 13 axioms of faith) and that is the reason for their power). God created the world based on two principles, chaos and order, which stem from the Divine names, 63 and 45. The purpose of creation is to integrate them and bring them up to the name 72. An old philosophy paper I wrote as a teenager: A. "To examine an object pedantically is not to think. It is an examination by a specific formula which has no bearing on the idea itself. It is examination from a different viewpoint than that of the idea's maker and cannot do (accomplish) anything. It is insensitivity to the idea. It is lack of understanding. [For example] to examine myself from an entirely psychological and rational point of view is not to understand myself.</p>
            <p>B. "Assuming that a person's essence is always good and that he can always choose what course of action he will take, then the closer he gets to his soul, the more the soul will control his will. And the more control the soul will have over the will. C. Genius is a sign that one is in contact with his soul. D. One can understand the logic of an idea, but not its essence until he is one with the idea. E. The bricks of the universe are beauty, and its blueprint is God. Beauty is the substance and God is the concept. [The idea or the form in Plato's terminology].</p>
            <p>F. "But true thinkers think with concepts and ideas with no root either in self or words or in logic. Pure thinking is just a free interplay of concepts between the mind and the soul with only intuition used to choose the good from the bad. If the ideas truly come from the soul, then they will eventually fit into the world of logic either by the one who thought it... or the idea will die until another time to be given birth by another mind. Ideas in this form are truly logical and not just rational.</p>
            <p>G. Logical thinking results in a creation of value or of no value depending on the path of the logic taken by the mind. Many paths may seem logical to the mind with only one resulting in some valid result. To find that path one needs the help of the soul.</p>
