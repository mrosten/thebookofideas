<h2>Chapter 6: Reward And Punishment</h2>
            <p>God rewards the wicked for their good deeds in a temporary world, and the righteous are rewarded in the Eternal World. This calculation is precise and strictly fair, though hidden from our eyes.</p>

        'lower': "<strong>Lower Gan Eden (Emotional):</strong> Reward for good <em>actions</em> and positive emotions. A place of spiritual rest and emotional delight.",
        'middle': "<strong>Middle Gan Eden (Speech):</strong> Reward for guarding one's tongue and speaking Truth. This is the world of holy speech and integrity.",
        'upper': "<strong>Upper Gan Eden (Intellectual):</strong> Reward for the integration of the mind and soul. Those who sought God with their thoughts and feelings reside here in the 'Light of the Face'."

            <p>Now this is certainly in accord with Genesis - but I would like to say that it also goes along with the rest of the Torah. For, the places in the Torah where it guarantees reward for good deeds is always in plural and referring to the Jewish people as a whole. So, it only is saying if the 51% of the people are good, then 51% will have good. They might be 49% of the bad and 2% of the good who will have good. At any rate in this world the evil people succeed and have money, children, and happiness.</p>
            <p>Yet, God gives good to the righteous eventually by preserving them, even if it is in a lowly way and by raising their horn [honor and happiness in the end.] If the majority of one's deeds are good, he is rewarded in the Gan Eden of Earth by the light of God shining upon him here and punished for his bad deeds in this life by bad events. If the majority of one's deeds are evil, he will be punished in hell and here on Earth have physical comfort. However, for good words one is rewarded in the lower Gan Eden and punished for his bad words in this world if the majority of his words are good in quantity and quality. If the majority are lies or evil talk, he is punished in hell and rewarded for his good words here. If the majority of his thoughts and feelings are good, then he is rewarded for them in the higher Gan Eden.</p>
