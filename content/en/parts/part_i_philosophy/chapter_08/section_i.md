            <strong>The Kabbalistic Key</strong>
            “Everything is dependent on Kabbalah. Our lack of involvement with it causes the delay of the building of the Temple.” “…and when we will repent on this and occupy ourselves with this wisdom (Kabbalah), the Jewish people will be redeemed.”
            <br>— Rabbi Chayim Vital in Introduction of the Eitz Chayim. (Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato writes along the same lines in the Pri Eitz Chayim.)

            <p>INTRODUCTION The redemption is one of the most painful subjects. All Israel expected the Messiah to come at the end of the second Temple period and deliver them from the Romans. This was correct to expect, since the prophets that predicted the destruction of the First Temple clearly imply that when the Second would be built that the Messiah would then come then, and that it would last forever. Well — that prediction proved wrong. Then, after its destruction they were expecting Bar Kochba to deliver them — that also didn't work. Then there were predictions in the Gemara that proposed some dates within a hundred years. Then the First Authorities placed their predictions for a hundred years after their time. Then, we got an assortment of saints that tried to bring the Geulah themselves and all failed. Then, Chabad got into the Messiah business and in fact made a lot of money doing so.</p>
            <p>The Messiah revealed the same idea to the Baal Shem Tov in his vision on Rosh HaShanah when the Baal Shem Tov asked “when will you come?” He answered “By this you will know: when your wells will overflow and they will be able to do unifications and rise to higher worlds like you, then will be a time of grace and salvation.” <br><br>The teachings of the Baal Shem Tov to a large degree are contained in the books of his disciples. Rabbi Nachman never claimed that his teachings stemmed from them but in fact Rabbi Nachman gives the handles by which it is possible for every person to hold on to the lessons of the Baal Shem Tov.</p>
