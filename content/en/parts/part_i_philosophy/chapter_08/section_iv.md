<p>Rabbi Yochanan, “all the prophets prophesied only for the days of the Messiah, but as for the next world no ‘ eye has seen it ’ , and this disagrees with Shmuel for Shmuel said , “ there is no difference between this world and the days of the messiah except for enslavement of Israel to the nations.” Shmuel is saying that all the prophecies of the Bible about the days of the Messiah are referring to the time of the revival of the dead and don ’ t refer to this world at all at any point.

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said, 365 years, which puts it around the birth of Albert Einstein and Rabbi Israel Abuchatzera. 7.) Rav Hillel says, “There will be no Messiah for Israel, for they already enjoyed it [that period] in the days of Chezkia” (Sanhedrin 99-A). 8.) “The redemption of Israel will be like the rising of the sun” [Midrash], i.e. , slowly but surely, and during that period it gets so light that you think the sun will rise in a minute when in reality it is still very far away.
