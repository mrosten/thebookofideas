<h4>The Orchard of Knowledge (Pardes)</h4>
<p>The Rambam openly states that learning science and kabbalah is the "Great Thing" (the Divine Chariot), while the legal discussions of the Talmud are the "Small Thing." He includes these wisdoms in the commandment to learn Torah. Science is a garment for Kabbalah, providing an <em>outer light</em> that surrounds and protects. To the Rambam, science explains the inner laws by which the physical universe works, while Kabbalah explains the laws of the spiritual worlds.</p>

<p>This does not contradict Rabbi Nachman. While he railed against the "philosophes" of his day who tried to build a utopia without God, he also quoted Socrates: <em>"The highest knowledge is to know that one does not know."</em> The geniuses of science and religion always point in the same direction: there is no true conflict. Revelation and reason are both necessary poles of the same oscillation that spurns growth.</p>

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>The Tempo of Truth</strong>
Every book has its own tempo, just like music. It is important to read at its given tempo, prioritizing the "love force" over immediate mechanical understanding. As the <em>Yerushalmi</em> says: "All are prone to sickness if they lack music." The beauty of science and math revives the soul, allowing it to vibrate in resonance with the Higher Sephirot.
</div>

<p>One word of learning Torah is worth more than all the physical commandments, yet Science (Understanding) and Kabbalah (Wisdom) are higher still. Prayer, the attachment to the Crown, is the pinnacle. By wanting to learn, one merits the stirring of the heart, becoming one of the "wise in heart" who merit to complete the Work of the Divine Tabernacle in this world.</p>
