            <h4>The Dynamics of Chaos</h4>
            <p>The formulas of Halacha result in an infinite variety of applications because of the slight variations in each person's individual soul and world-line. This is the <strong>Spiritual Science of Chaos</strong>. Without it, one cannot understand why the Torah commands us "not to add" to the commandments. Excessive restrictions can crush the unique patterns of chaos that provide the vital energy for serving God. The goal of the Oral Law is to provide a generality, but one that respects the individual state.</p>

            <h5>The Constant Source</h5>
            <p>The Written Torah is invariant across all frames of reference. Like the laws of physics, it remains constant, though the observation of it may change based on whether one is in an inertial or accelerating frame.</p>

            <h5>The World of Probability</h5>
            <p>Much of the Oral Law is based on probability and majority rule. Before a case is judged, it is a wave pattern of possibilities. Once the court observes and decides, the wave collapses into a particle of law.</p>

            <h4>The Thirteen Principles</h4>
            <p>The thirteen ways to derive law from the Torah are not just tradition; they are "from Heaven." However, their <em>application</em> is subject to human debate. Proven through one of the thirteen principles, a law carries Biblical weight. This tension between the "Inner Truth" of the Kabbalah and the "Outer Truth" of the Halacha is a continuation of the primal conflict between Joseph and his brothers. It is a war that repeats in every generation, as the rabbis struggle to integrate the insights of the mystics until they become part of the collective tradition.</p>

            <strong>The Relative Frame</strong>
            Israel behaves like a gas in equilibrium; the laws of the Torah apply most directly there. Outside of that state, we must rely on statistical methods to understand the Divine will. This is why laws that would "invalidate their purpose" (in the view of Rabbi Shimon) do not apply in non-equilibrium settings.
