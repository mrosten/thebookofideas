            <strong>The Spectrum of Faith</strong>

            <p>Faith is a force that encompasses various forms.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>The Scientist:</strong> Faith manifests as the drive to understand the physical world.</li>
            <li><strong>The Mystic:</strong> Faith manifests as the understanding of God.</li>
            <li><strong>The Devout:</strong> Faith becomes the vessel for needs. While a non-devout person must act physically to achieve a result, a devout person's faith <em>is</em> the action.</li>
            </ul>
            </div> According to the Jewish viewpoint, most spiritual systems represent a valid frame of reference locally, provided they meet certain criteria (e.g., Noahide Laws for non-Jews). However, mixing them randomly "mixes up the flow."</p>
            <h4>Faith and Reason</h4>
            Today, we can empirically test many claims of the Sages. Religion itself may have little effect on character—it is a tool, a map, but not the vehicle. To truly ascend, one must combine Faith and Wisdom.
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            "Wisdom cannot refer to the Torah because the Torah is actually Binah (Understanding) in the clothing of Glory."
            </blockquote>
            <p>One needs two Sephirot revolving around each other to create the radiation necessary to affect character. Faith alone is static; Faith plus Wisdom is dynamic.</p>
            <h4>The Problem of Character</h4>
            The Bible is a tool for those who <em>want</em> to improve. But those who want to be evil can also find support within it. Therefore, the character of the person determines the efficacy of the religion. As the Sages said: "To the worthy, it is an elixir of life; to the unworthy, it is a poison."
