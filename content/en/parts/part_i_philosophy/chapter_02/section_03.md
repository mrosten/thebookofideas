            <p>One can never really "change" one's religion. Religion comprises the stories, songs, and consciousness absorbed in childhood. Changing labels often just silences the self or transfers old dogmas into new vessels (e.g., bringing religious intolerance into politics). The Catholics were clever to incorporate elements of conquered cultures. Similarly, the <strong>Rambam</strong> explains that the Torah incorporated the practice of sacrifices—not because they were ideal, but to elevate a practice the people were already accustomed to.</p>
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            "It is obvious to me the grand departure from the ancient Torah way of life by the Jews was the result of the rabbis not being able to evaluate what really was acceptable in tradition, and what was compatible."
            </blockquote>
            <p>True renewal requires discerning what to keep and what to elevate, not blindly rejecting or accepting.</p>
