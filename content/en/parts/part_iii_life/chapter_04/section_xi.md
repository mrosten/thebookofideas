<p>emotions of the evil side are love of cruelty, love of sex as a physical act, love of lying, or not learning wisdom etc. T wo things one must be careful to avoid: fame and illicit sex [i.e., sex outside of marriage]. The reason is not that either of these things are evil, but because they are dangerous. Sex and honor are incredibly powerful sources of energy and just like atomic energy, if not handled with extreme caution they can be deadly. Now sex even in marriage is by no means necessarily holy but certainly less dangerous since there is at least the surrounding light of the marriage commitment.</p>
            <p>Now the story that Rabbi Adam Baal Shem told the Baal Shem Tov about his previous gilgul shows that one must be careful not to reveal any good deeds one has done or anything one has learned. It seems clear from the Lekutai Moharan that the reason for this is that saying the good deed gives the kelipot an ability to attach themselves to it. Rabbenu Yona explains that making a Rav [teacher] for oneself means even a friend. The Yerushalmi [brought by the Rambam and Rabbenu Yona] says even any old man from the street. [The incident where there was a rabbi wanted to decide a halacha, so he said, “Bring in an old man from the street.”] There are two kinds of honor: one Divine honor and the other honor of men. Honor is a surrounding light from the sepherah of M alchut (or understanding).</p>
            <p>Sometimes a person has neither type, and in his case any fame or publicity he gets will be just the evil eye and be very damaging for him. Other people do have one or the other type of honor and in their case the fame or publicity doesn't hurt them. However, in the case of the Divine honor, if one has it shining on himself, but he is a sinner then he will be infamous and despised. These purifies him so that he can continue to receive that Divine light.</p>
