<p>take a seat on a train or bus and then change it you will find the second many times to be worse than the first. Many times, there is a hidden hand which guides us, though we are unaware of it. Many times, one doesn't find what he is looking for or understand what he is learning until he gives up looking or trying to understand. This is because the thought or the essence of what we are looking for, has gone into the surrounding circular light. When you let go then you are guided back to the right place, or the right thought is guided back to you. That's why Einstein discovered Relativity only by sleeping on it, and most great scientific discovers are the same (this is to say that of course you can't find what you want or understand what you want unless God wills it to come to you at that time but the reason he uses this round about method of accident is because the idea has to come from the surrounding light into you.) Thus, we find Issaac Newton was prompted by the falling apple, Mendeleev was revealed the periodic table in his dream. I've heard that Churchill got his best ideas during World War II, while relaxing in the bathtub. In fact, penicillin; the thin layer of the galaxy, and so many more discoveries are by accident. Feynmann was prompted by a student flipping a plate in the dining room. Even the theory of chaos came in such a way).</p>
            <p>I used to be annoyed when there was a fly in my room until I noticed that Analytic Geometry started by Descartes watching a fly in his room. It occurred to him that you could describe its position by three coordinates. What would have happened if he had gotten up to chase it out? At any rate I figure if a fly could start Analytic Geometry, then flies can't be that bad -- remember the event with King David and the spider?! When I have to run to something usually it turns out that I never should have gone or that there was no need to run. As the Sages say, “He who presses the hour, the hour presses him. He who is pushed away by the hour, the hour stands for him.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Israel of Kaznitz said, “when one has a sudden urge to do a good deed, it's a bad sign”. Rabbi Nachman said not to be stubborn. Anything that is a true mitzvah must be worked on for a long time in order to do it. However, when the time for a mitzvah comes one should do it right away and not delay in order to do it better later (as the Mishna Brurah says). Direct your energies towards a single goal - the goal your heart says is right, (not your mind or logic.) Don't aim for two targets for then you won't hit either.</p>
            <p>Concentrate all your fire on one target. One's spiritual energy usually isn't</p>
