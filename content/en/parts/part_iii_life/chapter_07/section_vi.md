<p>the learning of the Talmud as from the Mikvah. The Noam Elimelech said: Moses came to his level by doing unifications every day immediately (in the morning) when he woke up. [The Ari said Moses and Binyahu ben Yehodaya both did that type of service.] Rabbi Nachman said the main thing is “hisbodedut”, private conversation with God. These are three types of Divine service that three saints said could bring a person to a high spiritual level. I wonder if these maybe are the “three types of service” that the Messiah revealed to the Baal Shem Tov that if any person would do them along with three specific unifications, they would be able to “make unifications and rise to the higher worlds like you.” The Baal Shem Tov had to swear not to reveal them, but it would make sense to say that he himself did them. Though he did many types of service we know the mikvah was a major factor. For other things he did, we would only be guessing if they help. Anyone could suggest a bunch of things that happened to appeal to them, like learning Gemara , learning Zohar , fasting, davening early at sunrise, saying the midnight prayer, this would all be speculation.</p>
            <p>But on those three things [Meditation on God's Divine names, private prayer, mikvah] we have the testimony of three saints that they work. Rabbi Nachman is the level of Messiah of David who combines Royalty with Beauty and whose higher root is the Crown. Jesus is on the level of Messiah of Joseph whose root is Foundation and whose higher root is Wisdom. One needs both - as one sephirah by itself produces no energy. Only when they revolve around each other are useful fruits produced The way of telling if a person is a saint is if you feel good around them. This is because holiness permeates the area surrounding a saint.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of saints: the hidden and the visible. The hidden saint is accelerating towards God and thus is invisible to inertial observers some or all the time. The world-line of this saint is a hyperbola (which is the root of the letter Kaph), which stands for the crown, for this saint is on the level of the crown. [This is due to the fact that an event horizon can result from acceleration, not just a gravitational field.]</p>
