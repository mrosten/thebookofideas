<p>your children. Respect your children. They are the same people they will be when they are adults. If you are angry with your children, this is a sure sign that judgements are dwelling on you. Assume you are wrong. Rabbi Nachman gave said some advice which I think is particularly appropriate for raising children. One of his major principles was, “Not to be stubborn about anything in the world”, which in Hebrew has a little different connotation than in English. It means not to force any issue with children. Also, he said not to slug them. Which in modern day Breslov is interpreted to mean not to hit them at all but I can't imagine that Rabbi Nachman really meant that. However, it probably is a good idea to not hit at all.</p>
            <p>For Children For children let me warn you the worst thing you could ever do to yourselves is to cause your parents pain (emotionally). It's worth it to give up a lot to keep your parents happy - even bad parents. I understand there can be exceptions, but this is a general rule. One who stands alone without his family will probably fall into some trap the religious and political fanatics of the world like to set for people. This is an important principle in life. (Sometimes a parent can be lacking all parental feelings, and thus be unfit to advise his children, but in the natural scheme, one's best friend will always be one's parents.) The Sages say that one should hold on to the profession of his father. This in fact is the case in a spiritual way, but the meaning isn't that one should do nothing else, but that one should do something related to his father’s profession or interests.</p>
            <p>Your parents provided you with your car and road map. The great saints like Jesus or Rabbi Nachman wrote the road map, and their disciples printed it. But your parents bought and paid for it. So, the saints deserve praise for the general lighting of the road. But you owe your parents for your specific light. Rabbi Nachman implies that the general correction is the most powerful, however both are important. A person whose life function is analytic (like a sine or cosine) can be expanded into a Taylor series — and therefore one should have children. And since the sine or cosine is periodic he can be represented as a Fourier expansion <???> (A)+ S [(a)(sin nx) +(b)(cos nx) f rom zero to infinity, where the first term is what God gives and the second is from the mother, soul of the mother, soul of the soul of the mother etc., and the last term is from the father, soul of the father, etc. (The reason people’s lives are, in general, sine or cosine functions, is that the life-force drawn into the empty space is an oscillating AC current.</p>
