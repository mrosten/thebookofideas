<h4>The Taylor Series of Life</h4>
            <p>A person whose life-function is analytic—one that flows smoothly and logically—can be expanded through their children like a <strong>Taylor Series</strong>. Each child is a new term in the expansion, carrying the essence of the previous generations while adding their own unique frequency.</p>

            <p>Because the life-force drawn into our world is an oscillating AC current, human lives function like <strong>Sine and Cosine waves</strong>. We can be represented by a Fourier expansion:
            <br><br>
            \[ f(x) = A + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n \sin nx + b_n \cos nx) \]
            <br>
            In this spiritual mathematics, the first term is what God gives, while the subsequent terms represent the souls of the mother, the father, and the infinite lineage that precedes us.</p>

            <strong>The Debt of Light</strong>
            While the great saints like Jesus or Rabbi Nachman provided the "general map" of the road, your parents "bought and paid for" your specific vehicle and gasoline. The saints deserve praise for the general illumination of the path, but you owe your parents for your specific light.
            </div>
            <h4>Honoring the Root</h4>
            <p>The worst thing a child can do is cause their parents emotional pain. Even with "bad" parents, the general rule is to maintain their happiness, for a person standing alone without their family is easy prey for the fanatics and "traps" of the world.</p>
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            "One’s best friend will always be one’s parents in the natural scheme of things. Hold on to their interests, honor their profession in your own spiritual way, and remain part of the analytic expansion of life."
