<h4>The Soul-Mate Percentage</h4>
            <p>The concept of a "true mate" is not binary, but a matter of percentage. While the Rambam suggests that choice is the primary factor, the Kabbalistic view is that every person has several potential mates with varying degrees of spiritual connection—20%, 50%, or 100%. Finding a mate is a deep sifting process, often serving as a correction for mistakes in previous lives.</p>

            <p>The revelation of an already existing eternal bond. This union can weather any obstacle, as its essence predates the physical world.</p>

            <h4>The Modern Plague</h4>
            <p>The inability to find a proper mate has become a "modern-day plague," much like the inexplicable judgments of history. This challenge often stems from the idolization of sex over the sanctification of the act. When the sexual act is made part of Divine worship, it transitions from a mere physical biological drive into a part of the soul's vertical ascent.</p>

            <strong>The Character Test</strong>
            Kindness is the ultimate litmus test for a potential mate. As seen in the story of <em>Titanic</em>, Jack's willingness to give his life for Rose was rooted in his general kind character—he was a person who would jump into the water for anyone. A kind person will be kind to their mate, while an selfish person will eventually turn that selfishness inward.

            "There is such a thing as finding the right person and knowing that it is so. But if the love isn't a readiness for self-sacrifice, it is best to wait until the true tested spirit is revealed."
