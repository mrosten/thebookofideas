<h4>The Echo of the Curse</h4>
            <p>In the architecture of prayer, there is a dangerous blessing: the one intended to curse slanderes and enemies. While tradition records it, the mystical warning is clear: do not pray for the destruction of another. A curse, if the recipient is not fully deserving on that specific day, has a "Strange Loop" habit of returning to the one who uttered it. It is far better to pray for the elevation of the situation than the downfall of the individual.</p>

            <h5>The Arena of Action</h5>
            <p>According to the Rambam and Rabbi Nachman, man has <strong>total free will</strong> in what he does. This includes the choice of a marriage partner. There is no "predestined" soulmate; you choose your partner, and that choice becomes your reality.</p>

            <div id="view-fate" style="display:none">
            <h5>The Resulting World</h5>
            <p>While you choose your actions, you do <strong>not</strong> choose what happens to you as a result. The circumstances, the outcomes, and the "destiny" of your environment are the domain of God. We pray to align our choices with the highest possible outcome.</p>

            <script>
            document.querySelectorAll('input[name="destiny-mode"]').forEach(radio => {
            radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const isWill = document.getElementById('mode-will').checked;
            document.getElementById('view-will').style.display = isWill ? 'block' : 'none';
            document.getElementById('view-fate').style.display = isWill ? 'none' : 'block';
            });
            });
            </script>
            <h4>The Soulmate Paradox</h4>
            <p>One should not pray for a "true soulmate," for such a concept implies a lack of free will. If marriage were predestined, the commandment and the effort would be hollow. Instead, we pray for the wisdom to choose correctly and the merit to build a home of peace. Marriage is a construction of the will, not an accident of fate. By choosing a partner and dedicating oneself to them, one <em>becomes</em> their soulmate through the shared integration of their lights.</p>

            <strong>The Prayer of the Wise</strong>
            The wise person prays not for God to change His mind, but for their own mind to be changed—to be elevated to a level where the current "judgment" is no longer relevant. This is the secret of the 18 blessings: they are eighteen steps of ascent into the higher worlds.
