        <dt id="13-principles">13 Principles of Faith</dt>
        <dd>Thirteen fundamental principles organized by the Rambam that define Judaism. These principles are derived
                from the Talmud, but were organized and clarified by the Rambam.</dd>


        <dt id="adam-kadmon">Adam Kadmon</dt>
        <dd>The region above Emanation. It is associated with the crown on top of the Yud of the Divine Name.</dd>


        <dt id="baal-ha-tanya">Baal Ha Tanya</dt>
        <dd>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. A disciple of the Magid of Mezritch.</dd>


        <dt id="baba-sali">Baba Sali</dt>
        <dd>Rabbi Israel Abuchatzeira, a Kabbalist of the Twentieth century, great grand-son of Rabbi Shmuel
                Abuchatzeira, a disciple of Rabbi Chayim Vital.</dd>


        <dt id="banach-space">Banach Space</dt>
        <dd>A normed space that is complete. Any normed space can be made into a Banach space by completing it.
                "Complete" means every fundamental sequence has a limit; it is like having an outside hull. A linear
                space is called "normed" if, for every element, there is associated a real number (a distance greater
                than or equal to zero) that satisfies basic qualities of distance.</dd>


        <dt id="binomial">Binomial</dt>
        <dd>An algebraic expression consisting of two terms. In this system, it can represent the dual nature of
                spiritual forces (e.g., Chessed and Gevurah).</dd>

        <dt id="breaking-vessels">Breaking of the Vessels (Shevirat HaKeilim)</dt>
        <dd>שבירת הכלים הוא מושג יסודי בקבלה, מעשה בריאת העולמות וכלל סידורם מעליון לתחתון לפי דרגות התכונות האלוהיות
                המכונות ספירות, תוך הפיכת עולם האצילות שבו אירע לדרגה העליונה בארבעת עולמות היסוד הרוחניים, וכן כיסוד
                הנדרש והמחויב להשתלשלות בריאת העולם הגשמי. המושג הופיע לראשונה אצל האר"י. It refers to the shattering of
                the spiritual vessels during the process of creation, which resulted in sparks of holiness being
                scattered throughout the physical world.</dd>


        <dt id="cantor">Cantor's diagonal argument</dt>
        <dd>A proof by Georg Cantor that the set of real numbers is uncountable. By taking a list of real numbers
                between 0 and 1 and changing the diagonal digits, one finds a number that cannot be on the list.</dd>

        <dt id="chasidus">Chasidus (Chasidism)</dt>
        <dd>The mystical and social movement within Orthodox Judaism founded by the Baal Shem Tov, emphasizing joy,
                faith, and the omnipresence of God.</dd>


        <dt id="chaya">Chaya</dt>
        <dd>The fourth highest level of the soul, associated with the level of "Life" energy.</dd>


        <dt id="empty-space">Empty Space (Challal HaPanui)</dt>
        <dd>The primordial "spiritual vacuum" created by the Tzimtzum (contraction) of God's infinite light, providing a
                "place" where finite existence can emerge. As Rabbi Nachman teaches: "Because of the compassion of God,
                He created the world... Therefore he made everything from the top of emanation to the center of the
                earth in for this purpose." (Lekutai Moharan).</dd>


        <dt id="guide">Guide for the Perplexed (Moreh Nevuchim)</dt>
        <dd>The philosophical masterpiece by the Rambam (Maimonides), which seeks to reconcile Torah with reason and
                logic.</dd>


        <dt id="henkin">Henkin Sentence</dt>
        <dd>A sentence in mathematical logic which asserts its own validity. In fact, it is always valid.</dd>


        <dt id="higgs-field">Higgs Field</dt>
        <dd>A physical field that, according to the Standard Model, transfers energy into matter, granting particles
                their mass.</dd>


        <dt id="hilbert-space">Hilbert space</dt>
        <dd>In mathematics, Hilbert spaces allow generalizing the methods of linear algebra and calculus to spaces that
                may be infinite-dimensional. Formally, a Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with an inner product
                that defines distance.</dd>

        <dt id="kabbalah">Kabbalah</dt>
        <dd>The esoteric and mystical tradition of the Torah, exploring the nature of God, the soul, and the structure

        <dd>The "Husks" or "Shells" of impurity which conceal the sparks of holiness. They represent the barrier between
                man and God.</dd>

        <dt id="metric-space">Metric Space</dt>
        <dd>A set where a notion of distance between elements is defined. The distance between two points is always
                greater than or equal to zero. This is distinct from a Banach space, where distance is associated with
                each single element.</dd>


        <dt id="matrix">Matrix</dt>
        <dd>An array of numbers each representing the value of a variable. In this book, the term refers to spiritual
                variables and interconnected equations in the structure of creation.</dd>

        <dt id="mitzvot">Mitzvot</dt>

        <dd>The ten divine emanations or channels of creative energy through which God interacts with the world. Related
                to the verse "To You O Lord is the Greatness (Chessed), the Power (Gevurah), and the Beauty

        <dt id="super-numbers">Super Numbers</dt>

                true that for all \( a, (0+a) = a \). It turns out that with this axiom, we have one axiom that says all
                natural numbers have a certain property and another which says there are numbers which do not have it.
                Thus, we have numbers that, if you add zero to them, result in a different value.</dd>
