            <p>Dedicated to my parents <strong>Philip</strong> and <strong>Leila Rosenblum</strong>, the greatest, wisest people I have ever known, and my children.</p>

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>Acknowledgements to my son Moshe who put his time, sweat and tears into this book. Much of this book consists of discussions I have had with him and my son, Nachman Isaac. To my brothers David and Keith who have stood with me all the years through thick and thin. They are the greatest brothers one could have.</p>
            <p>I did not originate the idea of using physics to explain the Torah. I got it from the book <em>Genesis and the Big Bang</em>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "By belief in the wise, we are able to bring our judgement to light. By belief in the wise of all the generations, one can find the right advice for all his situations."
                <cite>— Rabbi Nachman of Breslov</cite>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Nothing in this world is so powerful, as an idea whose time has come."
                <cite>— Victor Hugo</cite>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It is my hope that this book will show the higher root of philosophy and science and provide a basis for one unified system of science, philosophy, and Kabbalah.</p>
            
            <p>The world is a symphony made of different instruments all playing different parts of the song that only God can hear. This symphony is "the revelation of the Oneness of God", and the evil and cruel contribute just as much to it as the righteous and brave — for in the end darkness and evil will disappear by the light and by their disappearance God will be magnified just as much as the salvation of the good and just.</p>
            
            <p>This applies to every person just as much as in the world at large — for in every person the good essence in every person will rise and be grafted into the holy light and the evil will fall away and vanish forever as the shadows before the light.</p>
            
            <p>The root and basis of my path is faith — faith in all the wise men of history, and especially the Sages of Israel. It is the conflicts between the sages themselves which force me to formulate a theory consistent with the Gemara and the later Sages as well as with history and the plain facts of science. It just happened that in the course of my studies I noticed many connections between systems that were considered to be contradictory, and many times I noticed how the questions that one system couldn't answer were answered by another. So, I decided that, perhaps, there really is no contradiction, and there is really only one great system. So here is my attempt to formulate it.</p>
            
            <p>My motivation in writing this book was to give myself a reference book, to help me evaluate any new ideas or issues that come up, and see how they fit in the general scheme of things. My hope is that this will be a help for others also.</p>
