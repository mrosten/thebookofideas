            <p>Marriage and Family There are five colors of blood that are unclean, and the other colors are pure even if they are red. To the Shulchan Aruch , the Rambam and the Rif and the Rosh and all the major authorities the women of today aren't niddot because they don't have the feeling of the opening of the womb to let out blood. Rav Natrunai Gaon wrote that a nidah needs to go to the mikveh for marriage relations only as a rabbinical decree. It is Biblical only if she goes into the Temple in Jerusalem. So, we have a lot of doubts piling up one on the other all in a case of what the major authorities consider to be not unclean in the first place since there is no feeling of the opening of the womb.

After true midnight, after the mikvah. This applies only to when it's possible for children to come from the union. The main thing is for one to attach himself/herself to God while having sex and not to fall into physicality, rather spirituality. [You could say also that she doesn't even have to wait at all because of the first reasons] A man can marry two or more wives. The Cherem of Rabbenu Gershom was only until the year 1240 AD, as it says in the Shulchan Aruch, Even Haezer (h owever, in a country where this isn't allowed, the marriages shouldn't be on paper). The Gaon from Vilna said that to allow this would hasten the redemption for it would bring into the world all the souls that need to be born before the</p>
