            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>Gemara in Yevamot 76b says that King Solomon converted the daughter of Pharaoh . Tosphot  explains a later question of the Gemara to be , how could he have married her since she was a first generation Egyptian; and answers that he didn't really marry her but “attached himself to her for love” in the way of love, not in the way of marriage. Rashi explains that the Gemara asks how can the verse call it marriage. And it answers that he intended it to be in the way of prostitution. The Maharsha asks on Rashi then why was the Gemara forced to say she converted since it could have been “in the way of prostitution” without it.</p>
            <p>I think Rashi's reasoning must have been like this: A girlfriend is permitted to a King to all opinions [the argument of the first authorities only applies to everyone else] . The Gemara in Avoda Z ara 36 says that to the Rabbis opinion, marriage with the seven Canaanite nations is forbidden; and there was a later rabbinical decree to forbid all idolators. To Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai all idolators are forbidden to live with in the way of marriage from the Torah [but real kidushin isn't applicable] and the Beit Din of Shem forbid even to live with them in the way of prostitution.</p>
            <p>It seems clear to me that Solomon held like Rabbi Yehuda in Bava Kama 115a since he depended on the fact that the verse gave a reason why the king shouldn't</p>
