            <h3>Section VIII</h3>
            <p>Learning Torah One is not allowed to learn Torah having in mind to use it for a living. However, it is proper to learn Torah and to trust in God to provide in a way that he shouldn't be using the Torah or be receiving charity as both are forbidden. Rabbi Israel Salanter held that it is allowed to be a rabbi (and to earn money thereby) so it seems he depended on the Tashbatz even though it is against the Rambam. The disagreement between the Rambam and the Tashbatz is if one is allowed to learn Torah and depend on the idea that he will be given charity. The Tashbatz permits this. However, one is not allowed to say one verse or one word of Torah in order to make money. This is forbidden to all opinions, and one that does so has no portion in the next world. This includes the idea of taking a test in order to show that one knows some subject in Torah in order to get a kollel paycheck.</p>
            <p>Women are not allowed to learn Torah as the Rambam , Rif , Rosh , Tur and Shulchan Aruch write. The Talmud quotes Rabbi Eliezer the Rabbi of Rabbi Akiva: “It's better for words of the Torah to be burned than to be given into the hands of women.” There is an obligation of saying the parsha [section] of the Torah of each week twice and the Aramaic translation once. The way to do this is saying the section of every day once and then the Aramaic during the week. Then on Shabbat</p>
