            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>Rabbi Meir against the majority opinion it does seem that there is someone to depend on so I would have to allow it in case of necessity even though in all probability it may be considered spilling seed in vain to the opinion of the majority. [As the Gemara says,”Rabbi Meir is great enough to depend on in an emergency”.] A wife isn't allowed to leave her husband except in a case where there is violence. Just not liking him or his not being religious enough or too much , e tc., are not valid reasons. This is like the case which the Rema talks about when the husband was playing cards and desecrated the Sabbath, etc., and the Rema said the wife has no right to demand a divorce. Where the divorce is granted in such a case by peer pressure brought upon the husband it’s a get mu'usa (a forced divorce) which is invalid. It may be advisable for people who don't want this problem to depend on the mistress opinion and not have a full kiddushin.</p>
            <p>Marriage (kiddushin) is with two witnesses. However, according to the Ran [Rabbanu Nissim] on Kiddushin 16b, the Rambam holds that kiddushin by writing doesn't need two witnesses. Chupa is bringing into the wife into the husband’s living quarters, which needs no witnesses according to the Beit Shmuel in Shulchan Aruch. Ten people are necessary only for the seven-blessings. Sex is allowed without the blessings. The midrash says that angels are valid witnesses. At any rate, in conclusion, to get married in a Kosher way without witnesses one needs to do the Kidushin in writing and then to bring the bride into the husbands domain.</p>
            <p>Oral sex is forbidden since it is the equivalent of masturbation which the Zohar calls the worst sin in the Torah and that he who does so goes to the bottom of hell and stays there forever [unless he goes to the grave of Rabbi Nachman and says there the ten psalms]. The girl that does that to a boy gets the same sin. The</p>
