            <h3>Section X</h3>
            <p>Avodah Zara also says that the christians aren't idolators. The reason this is relevant is that there is not, and never was, any rabbinical decree not to marry a non-Jew who isn't an idolator. To the rabbis in the Gemara in Avodah Zara 36b, the Biblical law is only not to marry anyone from the 7-Canaanite nations and the rabbinical decree is not to marry any idolators. To Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who the halachah is like in this case, the Biblical law not to marry any idolators [“All those who induce to idolatry…”] and the rabbinical decree is not to have sex with them outside of marriage [this doesn't expand the law horizontally to include more people than the Torah forbids rather vertically to increase the degree of strictness. The law is like Rabbi Shimon in this case since the later authorities go like him. Thus, there is no law against marrying a non-Jew who doesn't worship idols]. In neither opinion is there any law against marrying a non­Jew who isn't an idolator.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Shimon specifically refers only to idolators and expands the law to include not having sex with them even out of marriage. To the rabbis in the first opinion the Biblical law is only the seven nations, and they expand it to include all idolators. Even though the language of the Gemara is “idolators” I think the rabbis forbid all non-Jews because otherwise who is the Braita in Mesechet Gerim that says marrying a Ger Toshav is forbidden, unless you want to say that is the opinion of Rabbi Meir that a Ger Toshav accepts on himself only not to eat non-kosher meat. [You could answer this in a thousand ways, but they are relevant to the Halacha which to them also doesn't apply after the seven nations aren't around anymore, as the Rambam says, so to them the whole rabbinical law is null and void since the situation it was made to guard against is non-existent.</p>
            <p>However, there is one more decree specifically not to marry a Samaritan for the specific reason mentioned in Rashi Shabbat 16b [see Mesechet Gerim] which only applies to them, since legally they are Jewish, but they don't keep the mensural laws properly. This simply doesn't apply to non-Jews. The Baal Shem Tov and the entire school of Chasidut are pretty regular in saying that the desire for money is equivalent to idolatry and I believe they mean it more</p>
