            <h3>Section VII</h3>
            <p>. I highly advice children to honor their parents no matter how bad they may be, but if there is a case where the child simply needs to protect himself from a destructive parent, then the child simply, should not speak to the parent at all and live elsewhere. The modern ideas of women's lib are against the Torah. The woman is obligated by the Torah to listen to her husband. He is not obligated to listen to her. Though it is advisable to honor her, there is no obligation halachically speaking. As Tosphot says in the beginning of Meshechta Ketubot, “The woman is the field [property] of the husband, and the husband is not the field”. If she refuses to do the three basic types of work and the five additional ones according to the Rambam she is beaten by order of the court until she complies.</p>
            <p>[Mishna Torah, Hilchot Ishut, 2]. If she wants a divorce under these circumstances, then the divorce is invalid since it is forced and not in accord with the law.  The reason for these laws is simple.The male or female soul is not an entity in itself, and the popular idea of individuality simply extinguishes the individual soul. There is no such thing as a connection with another person as long as all that matters is one's own benefit. The idea of each person respecting the individuality of the other is a lot of garbage.</p>
            <p>The human soul is buried so deep that the only way of finding it and expressing it is in connection with others. The expression of the individual can only exist when it is part of the whole - for then the divine light has a whole vessel to come upon. [And thus, the individual divine light that is the center of her soul can only come if she is connected with him.] The fabric of society is the family. Since the bonds that bind husband and wife together are dissolved in spirituality [Zei r and N ukvah ], they can't exist in physicality. Thus, America needs to return to being a Judeo-Christian society. However, those spiritual bonds have been broken for 2000 years. The reason families have still survived is because of the righteous that bind together the upper husband and wife. At any rate it would be logical to assume from this that saying the midnight prayer would help to get one and keep one married to his/her proper mate. But this is only possible not necessarily so since in the general surrounding light those bonds may no longer exist.</p>
