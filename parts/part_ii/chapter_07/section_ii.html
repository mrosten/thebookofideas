            <p>redemption and he said if he would have the strength, he would go from congregation to congregation to tell them this. A swimming pool is a good mikveh if it's plugged up so that nothing leaks - this is biblically speaking, but rabbinically, a natural body of water is better. Extra-marital sex is allowed as long as it is in the boyfriend-girlfriend form, not one-night stands. A mistress (i.e., girlfriend) is allowed according to the majority of the first authorities (i.e., one need not be married to have sex - Ramban, Raavad, Rosh, the Rambam according to the Ramban). There is teshuva of a later authority that allows it. However, kabbalistically speaking, it’s better to be married, because a mistress is on the level of the tree of knowledge of good and evil upon which the klipot can take hold -- which they do anyway for sensual sex even in marriage, but not being married makes the sex a bit more prone to them.</p>
            <p>Birth control like the pill is allowed. The condom is forbidden according to Rabbenu Tam. For the Gemara (Yevamot) says “three women have sex with a thick cloth in order not to become pregnant” since it could result in their death if they would become pregnant. Rashi explains they can put the towel there before sex. Rabbenu Tam says after sex. Rashi says they are allowed to while Rabbenu Tam says they must. So far for other women there is no permission to use a cloth at the time of sex. Those that are looking for a permission want to explain the Ritvah as meaning the towel is there at the time of sex and they must, implying that other women can.</p>
            <p>(See the Tshuva of Rabbi Abraham Shneur Zalman and the New edition of the Ritvah.) But the Ritva it says clearly that the three are required while others are sometimes allowed, eg. before they are twelve years old, and others are forbidden, e.g., girls older than twelve and a half. However, it seems to me to ask a simple question according to the opinion of Rashi: If a condom would be under the prohibition of spilling seed in vain then how could sex be allowed even for those three women? Shouldn't they simply not have sex? It seems to me from this that the prohibition isn't that of spilling seed but of the positive command to be fruitful and multiply and that is why the whole discussion in Tosphot revolves around that. So even though this whole thing is only like</p>
