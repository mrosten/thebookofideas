            <p>than a platitude, but as a halachah. Even though this may be hard to decide in a court of law, but I think they believed anyone who loves money has the halachic definition of an idolater. The implication is that even a religious Jew can come into this category. It is permitted to walk into a Catholic church even though there are statues there since the Gemara says in Avodah Zara 43b that the father of Shmuel and Levi used to go to a synagogue where there was a statue and weren't afraid that perhaps people would misconstrue their intentions (both Rashi and the Rosh explain that that statue wasn't just for beauty but rather was an idol).</p>
            <p>However, it seems to me that it is better not to go there, for it still is better not to pray in a place where there are idols. between the Gra and the Chassidim The argument of the Gra (Rabbi Eliyahu from Vilna) and the chasidim has always been beyond my reach because he (the Gra) really did say they (the chasidim) are klipat noga - and looking at them today who can disagree? But the one point I still hold by is that the excommunication wasn't on the Baal Shem Tov but the disciples of HaMagid (Rabbi Dov Ber from Mezritsh).</p>
            <p>I still can't answer the defenses of the Baal Hatanya who wrote that the excommunication was against those who disrespected those who learn Torah and the words of the Sages and he wrote, “I know that I do not disrespect those who learn Torah, nor the words of the Sages,  i.e., even if the excommunication may have applied to many or even all of his chasidim he knew it didn't apply to him. The truth be told, the excommunication of the Gra was outside the limits of the halachah -- to excommunicate half the Jewish people without even bringing them to court.</p>
            <p>The Gra held it was migdar milsa (the need of the hour) but further he may have had some type of Divine Spirit that in fact something was wrong there. So, if the excommunication applies, it any in any case couldn't have applied to Rabbi Nachman for neither he nor his parents were disciples of the Magid which were the specific target of the excommunication (in any case, I made a beit din by Shmuel HaNavi to nullify it.) This is the spiritual uncertainty principle in action.</p>
