            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>marry many wives, so he depended on the idea that if the reason doesn't apply the law doesn't apply. Thus, the daughter of Pharaoh would have been forbidden to him even not in the way of marriage unless he converted her. Tosphot it seems holds like the R abbis. So, she would have been permitted to him without converting, even as an idolator as long as it wasn't in the way of marriage or publicly. Then the question of the Gemara begins only after he converted her. [Incidentally Rabbi Shimon is the Tana in the Yerushalmi that says Solomon didn't marry her but intended her as a “girlfriend” like Rashi.] Rabbinical law only applies in a place and time that there is a possibility of transgressing the biblical law - this is a general principle throughout the whole Talmud .</p>
            <p>Specifically, reading from a light on Yom Kippur is permitted because there is no fear one will come to tilt. Rav sent to his non-Jewish friend in Babylon a present since he knew that he wasn't an idolator and the Rosh and Ritva explain the laws pertaining to non-Jews in general only pertain in places where there are idolators. Thus , since the seven Canaanite nations are no longer common among us [and to the Rambam no longer exist] to the rabbis marrying even an idolator is permitted. To Rabbi Shimon marrying an idolator is forbidden but marrying a non -Jew who isn't an idolator is permitted.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Shimon held in general that there is a logical basis for each commandment and in a case where that basis doesn't apply the commandment doesn't apply as in Bava Kama 115a where he says one can take as a pledge the garment of a rich widow since the law of the Torah of not taking the garment of a widow should logically apply only to a poor widow for the reason given there in the Gemara. This isn't the Halacha but there are many cases where we depend on Rabbi Shimon in a case of need in other opinions of his and we say “Rabbi Shimon is great</p>
