            <h3>Section VI</h3>
            <p>enough to depend on in case of need” as in new grain before the Omer outside of Israel. The Gemara (Nedarim 20) says, “The halacha is not like Rabbi Yochanan ben Dahavai,” i.e., in everything he said or just the last things. [Rabbi Yochanan Ben Dahavai said not to have sex face to back or to kiss in that spot or to talk at that time or to look at that spot. Rabbi Yochanan said the halacha is not like Rabbi Yochanan ben Dahavai, rather anything a person wants to do with his wife he can do. Most authorities hold Rabbi Yochanan meant the halacha is not like him only concerning face to back but the Rambam holds it refers to everything he said.</p>
            <p>It would seem to me this may explain the Gemara in Nidda that the house of Munbaz had sex during the day light and the Sages praised them because there was a necessity in their case. If we are deferring to necessity perhaps that implies a wider range of permission than the other authorities held from. However, from here we don't get permission for sex with a light on at night which the Gemara specifically forbids. [Obviously Yaakov Avinu held by this for otherwise why didn't he know that she was Leah, not Rachel]?! Just sex in the daytime or the other things referred to would be permitted. I think there may be some permission for candle-light for other opinions outside the gemara for this the Mishnah seems to imply explicitly. But I haven't found any such permission yet.</p>
            <p>And even if I would, the Gemara clearly doesn't hold by it. I vaguely recall some Yerushalmi that may have implied so much. If the mother or father transgress the Torah one is not obligated to honor them to the Samag and the Tur . The Rambam holds however that one is still obligated to honor them. However, if they transgress knowingly the Torah, even the Rambam would agree. The first category is not talking about wicked people it's simply like citizenship: people that don't keep the Torah are not in the category of “your people”; obligations the Torah imposes on citizens of the Torah don't apply. But people that transgress the Torah knowingly are much worse than not being citizens but are considered enemies of the state. I wish to add that when the mitzvah of honoring one’s parents does apply, the Yerushalmi calls it the severest of the severe of all the mitzvot</p>
