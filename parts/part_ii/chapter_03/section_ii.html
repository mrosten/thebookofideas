            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>actually is a public domain. To the Rambam in fact even a lonely dirt road between two cities is a public domain Biblically and carrying there four steps is against the Torah. However, I do believe that one can depend on Rashi and Tosphot whose opinion is brought in the Shulchan Aruch as a “Some say”. Apparently, Rabbi Yoseph Karo himself didn't want to make a final decision in this case. Perhaps because the Rambam holds you don't need 600,000 and the Rosh holds you do, and the Rif isn't clear. So, the Beit Yoseph couldn't use his normal method of using the majority of these three authorities. But if we continue his method of going in that case to the other authorities then the majority do hold by Rashi.</p>
            <p>Playing a musical instrument on the Sabbath is permitted. People in general are not experts in making musical instruments, so the reason for the rabbinical decree doesn't apply (i.e., that people might fix the instrument if it breaks.). This is in accordance with the opinion of the Rashbam and Raavad that once the reason for a decree doesn't exist the decree is automatically null and void. And even to the Rambam one can apply this (as it says in the book Or Zarua Le Tzadik of Rabbi Zadok HaCohen in Chapter 2). The reason he gives there is the same as the Rosh in the beginning of Avoda Zarah . The amazing thing is that the Rosh assumes a law made by the Sanhedrin only applies in the time and place it was meant for.</p>
            <p>It is allowed to use electricity on Shabbat. It is not fire. Nor is it Tikun Mana. (Each time you turn on your TV, you are not making a new TV set). However, one is not allowed to do any type of labor with it — like cooking. One is allowed to write on the computer on the Shabbat since the letters are not Ashurit (Hebrew script) and the letters are not stored in the viable form. So, this is a case of two rabbinical decrees — one against the other — and therefore allowed. Drawing on the computer on Shabbat however is forbidden.</p>
            <p>[The Shulchan Aruch says that to purchase land in Israel, one is allowed write up the documents on the Shabbat — since he is writing in a different language than Hebrew. However, the fact that it is a different language wouldn't be enough since that is forbidden rabbinically. However, the rabbinical prohibition is permitted in this case.]</p>
