            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>According to Abayee, the second day of the festival is not a rabbinical law, but from the doubt that the exiles had about the day they were extra stringent on themselves. We hold this way in Halachah and therefore in places where the messengers from the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem can reach by the fifteenth of the month, we only do one day of the festival… Now there are airplanes so automatically there is no reason to do the second day of the festival. [This however is only to Abayee but to Rav Asi it is a Rabbinical law.] Now it seems to me that this could apply to Rosh Hashanah. We can't depend on our calculations, but after the Sanhedrin sanctifies the new moon a simple phone call or e-mail from Israel, could tell us when the new moon was. Now even though the Cuttim could hack in to the computer still the Sages never made it a law that you can't depend on other direct knowledge from Israel. They did say you have to know the messenger, but couldn't you know the person on the phone too?! Thus, it seems to all the halachic authorities that go by Abayee that there is no second day of the festival. However, the Yerushalmi in Eruvin says the second day of Rosh Hashanah is a law from the prophets, and the Zohar also is pretty clear about this. So, I think we still have to keep two days of Rosh Hashanah.</p>
            <p>On Yom Kippur one is allowed to eat the amount ½ of an average egg every 4 minutes. If you go by the Noda   BeYehuda that would be the size of a full egg since he said that the eggs nowadays are half the size that the eggs the Talmud used to measure things. I don't recommend using this opinion to depend on. However, drinking is a different story. The amount one is allowed to drink is very small, i.e., the amount one can hold in one cheek of his own mouth. This is less than a teaspoon. However, to the Raavad one can drink this every 10 seconds. I think one can depend on this.</p>
            <p>The Gemarah says, “One who reads the Megillah between the other writings (Bibles with pages like our Bibles) has not fulfilled his obligation but this is only if he read it in a congregation but not individually.” That is, if he reads it at home for himself or his family he has fulfilled his obligation [see the Mordechai at the end of Megilah.]</p>
