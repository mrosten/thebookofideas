            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>each individual. One has what he knows in his heart to be the right intuition but disobeys it because of advice from friend or even rabbis. Or for instance resting on Shabbat: there are the 39 types of labor forbidden to everyone, however the idea and enjoyment of Shabbat is a highly individual thing. A possible reason the Torah says a woman can't be a judge is that she will tend to go against the male in a case involving a man and a woman while a male judge will tend to be more impartial since men have a natural sexual attraction to women but also a natural sympathy towards men since they are their own kind.</p>
            <p>But women have no natural attraction to men in general (they simply aren't turned on by the sight of a male), so they are automatically biased. (i.e., with men the two biases cancel out, but the women are left with only one bias). Whether or not the rabbis of the Talmud had the authority to make any laws at all is the subject of a debate in Avot DeRabbi Nathan: “Make a fence around the Torah. Make a fence around your words like God made a fence around his words, and Adam made a fence around his words, and the Torah made a fence around its words etc... What caused the woman to touch the tree? The fence that Adam made around his words. Because of this The Rabbis said: ‘If a man makes a fence around his words, he won't be able to keep his words.’ Thus, the Rabbis said, ‘a man should not add to the things he hears.’ Rabbi Yose said, ‘Better 10 inches and it stands than 100 yards and it falls.’ Thus, we find this to be the subject of a debate. What is interesting to note is that in any argument of any rabbis against Rabbi Yose the law is always like Rabbi Yose, but here the general opinion of the Gemara is not like Rabbi Yose – here there was probably a majority opinion against him.</p>
            <p>The Rambam gives the principles for the commandments: according to him they are not possibilities but the definite reasons. Thus, according to Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai who holds that when the reason for a commandment doesn't apply the commandment doesn't apply, there will be cases where one should not keep a certain commandment. I think that this wouldn't just apply to specific laws relating to the commandments but even specific situations. The Rambam makes it clear that these situations do exist, for he says that the Torah was given for the general situations but there will always come up situations where the keeping of a law will negate the intention of the law. It seems to me that in such a situation one should not keep the law, as the Sages said, “A sin for the sake of God is greater than a mitzvah not for the sake of God.” The specific intentions of the Law the Rambam states are: 1) To despise and reduce one's physical desires.</p>
