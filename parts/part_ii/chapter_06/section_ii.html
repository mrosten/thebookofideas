            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>But the truth is we have to rise above good and evil into the realm of truth and light and beauty [which is the combination of truth and light-truth is the vessel that contains light] by development of one's soul and raising it to that level. The Torah requires you to do what your inner heart says in order to bring up the good in klipat noga and the darkness should disappear by the drawing of the light (here there are two kinds of good, the good on the level of good and evil; permitted and forbidden; pure and impure, and the other type of good on the level of higher light where evil is just lack of that light).</p>
            <p>Listening to one's heart isn't just good advice, it is a positive commandment. For the voice of the inner heart is small prophecy and a prophet is required to obey his own prophecy whether he likes it or not. God is strict about the laws of the Bible, but that strictness isn't about keeping the laws in the way they apply in general rather it's about how they apply to you alone — as we see you singular is the noun of many of the commandments. God's code of law applies differently to each person. [Two other major things that God is strict about are keeping what you promise to do for God in time of stress and emergency. He doesn't like it if when the danger goes away, you forget about your promise. The other thing, is things revealed in a dream] I think according to the way I see God runs the world that one should go to Israel for extended visits, but always retain connection with the country of originates.</p>
            <p>For instance, one can go for let's say three years and then come back. Then go back again. The reason is that parts of the Divine presence are still in exile so this connection with one's native land can't be broken even if he wants it to. The holiness of the land of Israel is still covered by the klipot and the reason for this is that parts of the Divine Presence are still in exile and needs its corrections in those places of exile. The Arabs don't recognize any fundamental right of the Jewish people to a state with well-defined borders. There is no way that a faithful Muslim can accept that since it is a basic principle of the Koran that land once under Islamic rule can never be ruled again by non-Muslims and it is a sacred obligation of every muslim to sacrifice his life to bring that land back to Muslim rule. Therefore,</p>
