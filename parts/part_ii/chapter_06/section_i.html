            <h2>Chapter 6: Israel</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>One should not go to live in Israel when it is surrounded by enemies who want to destroy it. The issue is what to do when it will be peaceful. The Rambam and Ramban hold that one should live there even before the Messiah comes. The question however remains about the oath in the Song of Songs not to go up as a wall which certainly seems to be the case in the creation of a state. Experience has shown that the oath is still in place since the end of the oath has been a constant factor there (i.e., “I foreswear you not to go up as a wall and if not, I will make your blood free for all.”) The Satmer Rav [Reb Yoel Teitelbaum] allowed his followers to live there as long as they would have nothing to do with the State. But there is no person in Mea Shearim who doesn't receive directly into his bank account money from the Bituach Leumi. The religious, as much as they hate the non-religious there, have exactly the same mentality. One can't help but be influenced by the place he lives in.</p>
            <p>There is a tremendous flow of light there, for which reason it makes sense to visit, but not to stay, since you are only theoretically a citizen but not actually. It is the equivalent now of living in a foreign country with the disadvantage that you think it's your people while actually they see you as you really are a citizen of the country you came from. Don't give up your family, your religion, your mate, your friend, or your country so fast. There may be times when it is necessary but then only under extreme duress. Rabbi Abba hid from Rav Yehuda because he wanted to go to Israel, and Rav Yehudah said that whoever goes to Israel is transgressing a positive commandment as it says, “They will be brought to Babylon and there they will be until I visit them says the Lord.” So, it's one of those things that some authorities say is a good thing, others say it is not, and in such a case its up to the individual to decide for himself. This is one of those vast areas in Torah where free will is given but in orthodox theology there is complete denial that these areas exist. This is one of the most essential points of this book - the fact that there is such a thing as free will even within the confines of the Torah- not free-will between good and evil but free will between two equally good things - and what you should do is dependent on your character and your individual mission in life. Within the strict confines of the Talmud, it is possible to permit just about anything and to forbid just about anything and both ways are correct, one way is from kindness and the other from strict judgement. Many people are somewhere in the middle.</p>
