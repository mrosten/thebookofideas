            <h2>Chapter 2: Marriage</h2>
            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>as many types of marriage as there are types of human beings. However, the basic types are: 1. The spiritual marriage: This marriage is the revelation of an already existing bond. This one can weather all obstacles, since its essence is eternal. But it requires that both mates be homo-spiritualis — spiritual beings. 2. The fun marriage: This is the marriage of the scientist philosopher whose motivating principle is curiosity and creativity. 3. The reasonable marriage: Not bad if based on feeling also, but reason is a very poor basis for human relationships.</p>
            <p>4. The community sponsored marriage, or the practical. i.e., those that wouldn't be together except for the honor one or the other has from the community and the community support. These are put together and kept together by the community. There is nothing holy about this. It is purely biological. Marriage of the Jewish orthodox are of this type. [In each of these four types, for the marriage to be stable they both have to be of the same type of person. But as you can see a stable marriage doesn't mean there is anything good about either person.] There is such a thing as finding the right person and knowing that it is so. But if the love isn't like that of Jack and Rose (from the movie Titanic ) where each was willing to give up their lives for the other then I would say live together for a year before you get married to see if you'll remain in love. [It is worth it to mention that Jack's willingness to jump in after Rose was due to his kind character, for he didn't know Rose at the time. The lesson is that a kind person will be kind to everyone regardless of who it is.</p>
            <p>All women come in pairs. That is one reason why to allow two wives. Every man either has no choice who to marry or two choices. Both are on the level of a true match. Just one makes more sense but there is no love, just like the other makes no sense but there is love. (Most marriages are the ones that make sense but there is no love.</p>
