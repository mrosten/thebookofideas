            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>Human emotions are the most powerful forces bending and breaking and building societies, philosophies, ideas, creating and destroying worlds, spiritual and physical. But of all the emotions, love is the most powerful, the highest of the seven lower sephirot (forces), but lower than the three higher ones (fields). At the time of the revival of the dead they and all those who are supposed to be together will be together - but that can only be accomplished by the readiness to give up one's life for each other in this world. But understanding is also on the level of self-sacrifice which shine upon those that love each other; and that merit isn't just for them but for the correction of the whole world - to create a better world at the time of the revival of the dead so that all loved ones will be able to be together forever in God's light in the physical and spiritual world which will all be one at that time, in the world that will be above time and space.</p>
            <p>A deeper way to understand marriage would be to apply it to the two sephirot of Beauty and Royalty. But the Divine Presence has fallen into the klipot, so many women end up marrying some klipah and bringing more klipot into the world unless she can free herself from the evil side. This is the reason it is imbedded in the nature of women to be attracted to money and power. Marriage in America is particularly unstable. One out of two or three (depending on the area) break down. The Jewish orthodox community which came from Europe took a generation to get “Americanized”, and now their ratio is quickly reaching the same level.</p>
            <p>Curiously though, in Christian communities where the family attends church regularly the ratio is 1 out of 40. In families where not only do they attend church, but also have daily devotional life and family prayer the ratio is 1 out of 400. These are staggering statistics. While I'm at this I will mention the other curious fact that the healthiest state in the USA is Utah. Now you might want to say that it is because it is in a desert region; but Colorado is the unhealthiest (and it is also in a desert region). The difference would seem to be the difference between the Mormons and Las Vegas. These statistics conform with the idea of Jesus being the Messiah of Joseph [foundation of Emanation the source of peace], for it is a principle of the Torah that by following a saint one is blessed.</p>
