            <h2>Chapter 2: Marriage</h2>
            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>worship. Men's problem is with lust; women's, with anger; legalize a man's right to be married to two wives and you solve both problems. Dividing responsibilities between two women whether there sexual or maintaining a household would be easier. The man won't be on their nerves the whole time asking for sex or needing to be waited on after a hard day at work. While one woman is a nidah the other would be available for sex. Why be stricter than the Bible? As the Sages of the Talmud say, “There aren't enough things God has forbidden, that we have to find more? If only we would just keep what is already there.” “All is confounded by all-mastering time; faith dies, distrust is born; and the same spirit is never steadfast among friends; for be it soon or late, men find sweet turn to bitter, and then once more to love.” - Sophocles.</p>
            <p>So - families should stick together through the ups and downs; they will come out in the end on top. When entering into a marriage one must be totally committed to making it work no matter what. But that isn't enough. You have to be aware of how committed your partner is to you. If it isn't the same degree, then all your commitment won't help. And if they are committed to things about you, but not to you, it also won't work. The only thing that can make a marriage work is that both parties have this commitment and the emotional ability to stick with a commitment.</p>
            <p>Those that are devout are attached to the divine trait of Ru lership, and therefore there is a flow of children to them as Rabbi Nachman explains in the Lekutai Morahan. That is the meaning of the statement of the Sages that the redemption won't come until all the souls in “spiritual storehouse of souls” will be born, which according to Rabbi Issaac Luria refers to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil which is the Divine trait of Ru lership ( this is the reason Rabbi Eliyahu from Vilna said that allowing two wives would hasten the redemption).</p>
