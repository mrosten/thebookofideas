            <h2>Chapter 7: Saints</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>A good way of really telling who is a saint is the test of time. For instance, the writings of Moses are doing pretty good still after 3000 years. So are the books of other saints. Modern-day so-called rabbis will be lucky if they are remembered 20 years after they have passed except as some foot note in a history book. It's impossible to know the answer to the criticism on any saint because of the uncertainty principle -- the better you know the answer the less you are aware of his being a saint. And the greater the saint is the less we can know the answers to the questions on him.</p>
            <p>The thing that made Rabbi Israel Abuchatzera and all the great saints, wasn't so much their prayer, fasting or learning, rather it was their tremendous desire to help people. When that desire exists in one, God gives him the ability to help people far beyond the rules of nature. The tools to help people are simple acts of kindness, but for people like Rabbi Israel Abuchatzara it was possible to go into the spiritual roots of the problem in the higher worlds and correct the problem's there, and that would trickle down to this world where the problem would disappear.</p>
            <p>Yet even a regular person can do that to some degree by prayer: By going to the shrine of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashanah; by learning Kabbalah and science; by doing the unifications of Rabbi Luria Ashkenazi By prayer with the intentions of the Rashash By doing the nullifying of judgments by the shrines of the saints in Israel By reading the whole Torah every verse forward and backwards and then saying the Divine Names that come with the verse. (The simplest way is saying the first letter of every word with the vowel under it as it is written in the Torah, then the middle letters with the vowel which is specifically for that letter, and then the last letter in the same way. (This method is good to use with the Lekutei Moharan which also has the strength to nullify judgments.</p>
            <p>The most important thing to do is to bring loved ones together.</p>
