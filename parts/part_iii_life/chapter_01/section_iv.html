            <p>character of Nitrogen in connection with one more. A Seven child family is inert like N2, but must avoid any connection with nitroglycerine-people, so that it doesn't form bonds resulting in TNT. Parents - spend time teaching your children your philosophy or they will get the world-views from elsewhere, i.e., spending time with them to teach math or just to talk isn't the same thing. Teenagers have to be bad. So let them be bad in something not so bad. When your teen comes home from school and wants to talk, never turn him down even if it is daily for hours. If he can't talk to you, he will find someone else to talk to that won't necessarily be to your liking.</p>
            <p>Children need your respect more than your love. The key to raising children is to assume as a given [an axiom] that if they say something that it means something. Don't think because you are some big shot parents that their feelings are meaningless. If you do you will eventually find yourself to be meaningless in their lives. One application of Game Theory in raising children is don't try to impose total authority. Assume as a political leader you can't get total control. But there are areas where you can have some minimal control. Maximize your minimal gains.</p>
            <p>Don't try to get everything. Try to get the greatest number of small gains. (Especially in a free society where children are well aware of what kind of world they live in and will not respond to a dictatorial parent. This is probably the case in general no matter what kind of environment it is, but in a free society the reaction is more pronounced. Parents are only parents to the older boy and girl. The older children are the spiritual parents of the younger children. It’s not good to be authoritarian, only authoritative. The reason is that the evil inclination is divided among the nations of the world and every nation has a different evil inclination [as per the Likutai Moharan ]. The evil inclination has to get divided up in every house in a similar way, and only a certain kind of leader can subdue it.</p>
