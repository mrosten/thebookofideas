            <h2>Chapter 1: Family</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>“Parents, do not irritate your children or they will lose heart.” -- Colossians 3:21 Ones close friends and family are part of one's soul. To cut them off is to put oneself at risk of cutting off a vital organ. Children leaving their parents home at the age of 18 are in general making a mistake, for the soul isn't ripe then and should still be attached to the tree. Every family is a tree. One can't cut himself off from any part of it without dire danger to himself. This refers to spiritual families where there is love, not to merely physical families.</p>
            <p>Families are the 10 sephirot: God, Father, Mother and the children. The true friends are the makifim (outer light). Enemies are the klipot caused by the breaking of the vessels, if they have some reason for their hatred. If not, they are from the empty space from which God removed his Presence in order to create the world. Eighteen is a very bad age to leave the home for the light from one's father which is the outer light doesn't come strongly until the age of twenty and it’s that outer light which is the strongest protection. Eighteen-year-olds don't realize they are considered a resource. So many institutions do everything possible to take them away from their parents physically and spiritually, which cuts them off from their roots and kills them (spiritually and sometimes physically), and sometimes that kills the parents also.</p>
            <p>In general, if the two parents are living together for the reason of love, then the children should not leave the home to live in a different state. For two people living together from love have more to teach their children than all the schools put together. The root of not getting along with parents starts from the brothers and sisters. One must get along with his brothers and sisters with absolute self-sacrifice. Siblings aren't people who would automatically be friends. Usually they are completely different, but they have a common root. Therefore, they must try to go beneath surface appearance to that common root.</p>
