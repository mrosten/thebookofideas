            <h2>Chapter 1: Family</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>decisions in ones life, one should have a meeting of his close family and friends to discuss it. (This idea is from George Fox.) I don't believe in asking rabbis or clergy for advice for they will always give advice in such a way that will get you sucked into their particular version of their particular religion. Look, it’s their way of making a living - can you blame them? But if you don't want to make a mess of your life, take count of all the people who love you sincerely or who have stuck themselves out on a limb for you, (i.e., family and real friends), find the majority opinion on any major issue affecting your life and stick with it. The idea applies only if they do love you and not just a relationship of convenience.</p>
            <p>Nowadays there is no pact [contract] between parents and children to stick together. But there should be. Just because society has forgotten what it means to have families stick together doesn't mean you have to. The commitment to stick together provides a makif (an outer protective light) that can ward off the klipot , just like marriage. (The commitment in a society to stick together also provides its unique type of makif (surrounding protective light) and that is the spiritual source of political systems.) Monarchy, democracy, theocracy, communism, socialism, republicanism, which are from the 6 sephirot, Kindness, Power, Beauty, Eternity, Splendor, and Royalty.</p>
            <p>The idea of family is to stay with each other through the ups and downs (i.e., since in every family there are going to be periods that each individual member goes nuts, that is the time every other member has to stick with them. As the Sages said, “accept and exist” -- i.e., accept what comes at you, lower your head and let the wave pass over, and then you will be able to stand). Commitment to sticking together as a family is an ideal which seems at first glance to cancel out all other ideals since there is always lot of inertia to prevent one from the direction, he thinks he must take; however, I think that the temptation to separate is in general a test of the evil side, and only if one stays firm, does he really come to that which he must (without breaking up the family). [It's always good to have lots of inertia. Some things need to be done but it's always good to sit on every major change for a long time. When I was in Kiev and my black friend John Jackson was with me, I remember some incident that I wanted to call the police about and he said no, wait. And we waited and it turned out ok in fact. I've never had an experience with the police anytime</p>
