            <h2>Chapter 3: Sex</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>- “For the gods are slow, though they are sure, in visitation, when men scorn godliness and turn to frenzy.” — Oedipus At Colonus by Sophocles “Joy of life depends upon a certain spontaneity in regard to sex. Where sex is repressed, only work remains, and a gospel of work for work's sake never produced any work worth doing.” -- Bertrand Russell There is something about sex which reacts against a person when it is merely physical. If it doesn't involve a spiritual bonding, it reacts. Sex demands to be treated with respect and as the bonding of two souls into one. If not, it gets angry like a jealous wife and exacts a price. Sex which is purely sensual spells the end of the relationship.</p>
            <p>There is no such thing as free sex (even in marriage). When one doesn't sanctify himself at that time, the price he pays is anger, i.e., he receives anger into his soul. Sex with sanctity draws love, kindness and blessing into the world. Sanctity in sex means the binding of the souls together and then bringing them up to God. It has nothing to do with marriage. Pleasure is on the level of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and therefore not good or bad in itself but dependent on what one uses it for. If one brings up the sparks of holiness in that pleasure into holiness, he himself goes up and the evil falls. Just saying a blessing has nothing to do with this. It depends a lot on what one actually does with that pleasure. If it’s having children, it depends on how he raises the children. If it's food, it depends on what one does with the energy. Pleasure for the sake pleasure remains on the original level and it falls into evil and becomes evil itself. Pleasure however for the sake of God and done with attachment to God is like a sacrifice and is on a very holy level.</p>
            <p>In a time that the matches aren't between true matches, God still draws the proper souls by one soul in the world who is on the level of Joseph (the sephirah of Foundation). This is bechinas (on the level of) what it says by Joseph “the girls jumped over the wall” to see him as Rashi explains there and also what it says by Rebbi Yochanan who waited outside the mikvah so the women coming out from the mikvah would see him and draw the souls that came</p>
