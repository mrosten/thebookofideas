            <h2>Chapter 3: Sex</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>into the world from the level of Joseph. Sex when it is an expression of Love is a mitzvah since all Love is of God. And when it is for physical pleasure, it is a sin even though it is within marriage since then it is from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . The Sages hint to this when they say only a disciple of a sage can eat meat since he brings up the sparks of holiness in the meat to God. Also, they said a person that marries the daughter of an earthly person transgresses the command “cursed is he that lies with an animal.” In a relationship, if the female says “it's over”, IT’S OVER. since women don't want the sex as much as the security which she obviously believes she has found in another way... Also, they are closer to the evil side since their root is in the lowest sephirah. Also, their root is related to the sephirah of judgement which makes them prone to anger [i.e., pure evil].</p>
            <p>Men are from the middle sephirah and thus want sex more and are less close to the evil side for sex in itself isn't good or evil. It depends on what one makes of it. According to the Talmud, “The man asks with his mouth and the woman in her heart,” i.e., the man actually has to ask for sex. This is opposed to modern ideas that the man is supposed to beat around the bush. However, isn't asking for anything in the category of idolatry?! The Sages say in another place, “one that asks for his portion is as if he stole it.” The answer is that if when you ask you know that in truth, “there is nothing besides Him,” and everything you see is simply the infinite light of God in these garments before your eyes — or put simply, everything you see is God at least as he manifests Himself to us. However, asking anything from someone that in your mind isn't included in God [even if you know that their granting the request is dependent on God] is idolatry. For that is actually the exact definition of idolatry. The Torah doesn't deny that there are other gods or higher angels appointed over the nations and over specific things like wisdom.</p>
            <p>The Torah is full of the existence of them. But you can't serve them. [This incidentally explains the verse there is nothing besides Him that Rabbi Nachman said is literal. Now you could ask, couldn't it mean there are no gods besides Him (as we find in the Torah the subject of a verb sometimes missing as Rashi</p>
