            <p>the side of evil is that the side of evil wants to destroy the good totally, while the side of good doesn't want to destroy the evil but to subdue it and allow it to exist. The principle that there is nothing besides God, one always has to accept from his arch enemy. Judaism never noticed it until they get it from Hinduism and Rabbi Chayim of Volozhin from the Chasidim, Rav Shik (of Breslov) from Chabad. The same time this concept came into Jewish writings -- the 1700s -- is the exact time the European community became infatuated with the Bhagavad Gita and the Sutras. At any rate, for what it is worth, I will mention that the kabbalah in the Pardes of Rabbi Moshe Cordavaro) has the exact middle opinion between Shankara and Ramanuga. The teaching of the Gita is exactly duplicated by the Baal Hatanya, that the only way to realize and come to the Oneness of God is by meditation on it.</p>

But within each group there is good and bad. On each level one must find God.</p>

Sometimes in life one should realize he has to come to the highest point he can get to. Carl Jung felt that in the middle age period a transformation comes. The sages said forty is the age of understanding. Many times, there were great leaders that ruined their legacies just by staying on a bit too long, -- and should have just found something else to do. The Melians thought they could hold out against the Athenians because they knew their cause was right and they knew they were more virtuous than the Athenians. If they had given up, they would merely have become an Athenian colony. Instead, they held on, and all the men were put to death, and the rest of the population were enslaved. Many times, it</p>
