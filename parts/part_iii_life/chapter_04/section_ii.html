            <p>besides Moses receive their prophecy only asleep and in dreams. He even says that if the prophet is awake, a deep sleep has to fall upon him before he can prophesize. This would seem to indicate nowadays there is reason to at least consider the possibility that a dream may be more than a dream. I have had dreams telling me what to do or telling me to follow certain daily rules [e.g., “You have no hope except to say the midnight prayer”, or cleanliness in the garments to the degree of changing even if there is a little perspiration; and.</p>
            <p>“You learn Torah. Physics is a side thing”, etc...] and I have regretted not following them. In Safed there was a fellow named Mordechai Shebabo who was a physical education teacher in the public high school. He also happened to be an expert fencer. He was on the Israeli Olympic team as a fencer. A few nights before he had to leave for the Olympics in Munich, he had a dream of Rabbi Moshe Alkebetz telling him, “Don't go to the Olympics.

(i.e., don't be attached to anything too much. Don't consider it yours too much.) God has a way of running things which show one that which he thinks is his, really isn't his at all.</p>
            <p>In any disagreement between the mind and the heart, one must go after the heart. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and upon your understanding do not depend.” (Mishle) i.e., don't depend on your logic, but the voice of God in the inner heart. (But not the desires of the outer heart. This is because human relationships are in the spiritual realm which isn't subject to logic).
