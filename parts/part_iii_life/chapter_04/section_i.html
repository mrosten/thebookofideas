            <p>(or Principles of Life) “One needs no cause. Whatever is decreed to come to one, will come without any cause at all. -Madregas Ha Adam (Rabbi Joseph Yozel Horwitz ) “Not he who fasts and prays is acceptable, rather he who knows HIM. -The Rambam in the Guide for the Perplexed , chapter 53.)

Many times, advice you receive in a dream will be much more accurate than even what good friends give. The Rambam held that the statement of the Sages that prophecy was taken from Israel meant only until the year 1240 and that in that year prophecy would return to Israel. He had this tradition from his father who received it from his father and so on. The Rambam also says that all prophets</p>
