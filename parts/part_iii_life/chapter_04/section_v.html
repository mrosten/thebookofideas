            <p>action is the slight difference between John Locke's democracy and Russo's. Locke made human rights supreme and government secondary, and that led to a democratic England and USA (until America became a socialist republic under the New Deal). Russo made the general will supreme and his book has been used as a blueprint for tyrannies and reigns of terror since then. Even though he emphasizes the importance of the individual, like Locke, he believes the public can decide what rights the individual can have. (It's interesting to note that Locke's idea of inalienable rights has nothing to do with believing that people are good, because he actually says that people are born as blank slates). Locke derives this from the Bible. This is far from the relative humanism of the Sophists. Rather this is a belief in absolute right and wrong and in human life has an absolute value on the scale of values that is inalienable. Life is from the sephirah of Wisdom, and right and wrong on the level of the lower sephirot, so life has a value above right and wrong. [But you may ask what about the penalties of the Torah? Those relate to values that the Torah places above life.] In general, everything that happens with a person is an expression of their personality. If one sees failure, he must know that it's only from his personality and its correction is only by correcting his personality. The only way one's future will be happier than the present is if one's future contains a radical change in one's personality. Some search for a happiness outside of themselves which doesn't exist. It can only exist inside oneself, if it is created there. The door to a better future is the heart — if you can open the door. Thus, we come to the advice of Rabbi Nachman of talking with God in a private place. This is a key, but it doesn't open the lock unless you make it do so. This can be misused and is no guarantee but can help and is a powerful help.</p>
            <p>I believe Rabbi Israel Salanter must have been trying to figure out how to change one's personality when it is a negative type. The best he could come up with was to learn Musar, (the ethical works of Torah.) But he must have been aware that many personality types will rise to unbelievable heights in the name of religion, Chabad, musar, Torah, etc. and will perform awesome deeds of righteousness for the benefit of all mankind but also inflict savagery and untold suffering upon millions of people (particularly non-believers).</p>
            <p>I believe the true cure for a negative personality lies in the idea of John Fox that a person's major decisions in life should be dependent on the vote of his/her family and real friends as a group coming together to weigh all the aspects together. This has the power of preventing a person from making serious mistakes. (“The</p>
