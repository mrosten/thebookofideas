            <p>is just time to give up. Yet one characteristic of winners is their lack of ability to give up on something that just drives them on no matter how bleak it looks. Like Rabbi Nachman said there is no such thing as giving up. (i.e., that even when one has given up God is still able to save him, so there is no reality to giving up.) Truman was a failure at 33, bankrupt at 38, yet President of the USA at 60. This contradiction perhaps can be answered by Epictetus: “The reality of good lies in what is in our power. Do not wish to be a judge or politician or a lawyer, but to be free-and there is but one way to freedom- to despise what is not in our power.” - Epictetus A key to self-evaluation is the opinions of one's true friends and close family. They may not see the whole picture, but when you put yours and their point of view together you get a three-dimensional perspective rather than your own two-dimensional or their two-dimensional point-of-view. This is a simple mathematical fact. The truth is that even one’s enemies point of view should be taken into account, because even if you allow for the fact that blind hatred is the reason for most of it there still is probably some kernel of truth.</p>
            <p>Some of the most important lessons in life one has to learn from one's enemy. The reason for this is that the world one lives in is really just a reflection of one's personality and stems from himself. Therefore, all ones' friends and family and enemies all represent different parts of one's own personality. Therefore, there is really no solution to one's problems except a basic change in their personality, which after the age of five is pretty rare.  However, I believe there is hope, for one's personality is actually a reflection of a higher element and that is one's philosophy-or world view. Change that and you have changed your personality. Even if the change is ever so slight it will still have an enormous effect on the events surrounding you.</p>
            <p>This applies to whole peoples also. For instance, Germany never had to give up the idea of their being a chosen race. They in fact have tremendous talents. (Similarly, the Jewish people don't have to give up the idea of being the chosen people. They in fact are a God-imbued people.) The problems come from false conclusions from the basic facts. World conquest isn't a logical conclusion of “chosen race”, but world betterment is. Germany could have avoided all the problems by an ever-so-slight-change in their philosophy. But in the long run, you can never really know who you are until it is all over.</p>
