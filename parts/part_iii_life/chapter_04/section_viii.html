            <h3>Section VIII</h3>
            <p>limitless, so you do have to deal with the fact that any goal to be achieved well is going to need your entire attention. The problem with hatred is that one becomes that which he hates, because the side of holiness doesn't hate anything in the way of wanting it destroyed, rather corrected and saved. The way of being saved from ones enemies is to judge them on the scale of merit. And pray for their good, spiritual and physical, in this world and the next, then your prayer will reflect off them like a mirror right back to you. And it may help them also.</p>
            <p>Archenemies are always almost completely identical (in ideas and in conduct). One side may in fact be right and the other wrong, but it is still striking how similar they are, e.g., the right-wing Israelis and the Palestinians, the hippies and the establishment. As the old saying goes, “extremes meet.” One should say the thirteen principles of faith of the Rambam immediately when he wakes up in the morning. One lacking money should say the chapter that deals with the manna in the desert. There is a tradition brought in Rabbenu Bachayee that one who says it every day will never lack a livelihood.</p>
            <p>One should pray with the intentions of the Rabbi Issac Luria in the Siddur HaRashash , except from Passover until Shavuot when the Rashash said not to do the intentions because that period is for the building of the sephirot. I always had a question on this because there is a distinction between the sephirot of the day and of the year, but apparently the Rashash held the if the sephirot of the year aren't built then you can't build the form</p>
