            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>peace with conflict. By doing kindness (many times) one suffers, but one should know that suffering would have come upon him anyway, in a different form, except that by doing the kindness the judgement is weakened. Learning heavy books which have to be done sitting down should be by making a pile of them on one side of the desk and doing the amount necessary and transferring them one by one to the opposite side of the desk. For lighter books one should lie down and hold them over his head so the blood rushes to the head and concentration is easier.</p>
            <p>For depression one has to go to the mikvah or a natural body of water and dip in his whole body and play a musical instrument in order to draw the surrounding light of Binah — Understanding. Never take yourself or what you are doing so seriously as to look down on others. It is very important to give every person respect because God created them for His reasons and has a place for everyone in His heart. Every person is born with a certain Tzelem” or Form that he is born into. It isn't in his power to change it. So, it isn't right to look down on anyone, even evil people. They may have the ability to change but so do you and how easy is it for you to change your character? When there are indications not to do something that one supposes is a mitzvah sometimes the indication is to tell you that it is not a mitzvah. However, the other times it is to tell you that it is an extremely important mitzvah. The only way of telling is to go into your closet and meditate until hopefully you get the right answer. The reason for this is that each person has a root soul in Emanation, creation Formation or the physical universe. Since each of these four worlds has varying degrees of evil the indications also will vary. Thus, a person whose root soul is in Emanation will have all the indications pointing in the correct direction. One whose root is in Creation will have the majority pointing in the right direction. For Formation the majority is in the wrong direction and for the physical person all the indications are in the wrong direction-which causes them to remain physical and never to try to rise above it. Those involved all day in physical activity are from the physical. Those involved in learning are from Formation. Those involved in meditation and prayer are from Creation and those whom the Light shines on the whole day are from emanation. Sometimes a lot depends, however, on the place also since for instance New York has only the light of Formation and the Physical. In some places like Israel the light of Emanation shine but the light causes souls of people not prepared for the light whose root souls aren't from emanation to break and become evil. California has the light of Creation. Thus, Israel won't be safe until collectively Jesus and Rabbi Nachman are accepted since then there would be a connection for every person with emanation in the way that wouldn't break their vessels.</p>
