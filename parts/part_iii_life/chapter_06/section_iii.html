            <p>sacrifice to the image of the emperor. However, after much effort was spent explaining to the Roman officials that the Christians were not a part of Judaism, the persecutions began at the time of Judge Pilany and continued for two hundred years. Now, to me it seems obvious who was the most anxious to exclude the Christians from Judaism. In fact, there was a very rich agnostic who wanted to exclude all references to the Jewish root of Jesus in the four Gospels — and was told to take his money and leave. It seems the early church wanted to preserve their Jewish roots. So, praying/cursing and hatred against the Christians just seems to have backfired against us. Perhaps it's about time to admit our mistake.</p>
            <p>Saving the world is not a noble occupation. It usually results in suffering, not help. If the world has ever been made a better place, it’s by the self-searchers who seek only to understand and correct themselves. Just because you get inspired by a place doesn't mean it’s any good. It may just be the sparks of holiness that have fallen there and see you and attach themselves to their root, i.e., your soul. What disturbs men’s minds is not events but their judgements on events. ­- Epictetus I have heard from almost every enemy I ever had (by way of conversation with them before they became my enemies), what their world view of people was — and it always was the same -- they look at people friends or relatives as assets .</p>
            <p>These people make it their business to get as many friends as possible to further their objectives. In retrospect, I can see why all these people ended up being my sworn enemies. They discovered that I think too independently to be an asset to anything or anyone. And it’s interesting to notice the world-view of all those who remained my friend. Invariably, they look at people from an extremely human point if view. If someone has betrayed you once, be sure that they will do it again if you give them a chance. This can refer to parents or friends or anyone or a collective community.</p>
