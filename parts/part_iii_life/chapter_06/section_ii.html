The Baal Hatanyah deals at great length to resolve the conflict of which is more important; the overall view [the name 52]; or the inner light of the specific details [the name 45]. 2) Taking a long time to get to the goal. Every day for twenty years is a lot more than cramming it in six months and forgetting. Thus, the idea of the Noam Elimelech: lessons every day to learn a little bit Bible, a little bit halacha, a little bit of science, a little Kabbalah, a little meditation.

The Sages of the Talmud say one who is kind in a place where cruelty is needed, will eventually become cruel where kindness is needed. You should pray for the good of your enemies but still guard yourself from them. I think this idea would explain most of the statements of Jesus, the Bible, the Besht, Buddha and the Sutras in this regard, so that there shouldn't be any contradiction.</p>
            <p>This is why I have written that the blessing in the eighteen blessings cursing the non-believers should be skipped. It seems clear from the historical record that the Christians were originally considered part of Judaism, and thus protected under Roman law and not obligated to</p>
