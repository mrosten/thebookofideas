            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>“Beware of any activity that requires the purchase of new clothes,” [ Thoreau ] because the clothes reflect the character and if the new activity involves different clothes, then it's not for you. Every person was created with a certain Tzelem {form} {world line in time and space} that he grows into. Therefore, any attempt to impose an external order on his life will fail. He can make plans, put in much effort and try with all his might, but if that order is not a part of his nature, and the nature of his world-line, it won't be successful.</p>
            <p>This is what Socrates meant by know yourself. Most people waste years of their lives and sometimes all of it trying to force some type of external order on themselves that they have been taught is right for them but really isn't. Christopher Morley said, 'There is only one success -- to be able to spend your life in your own way. [quoted in the New York Post by Nelson and Dauten]. But even so, happiness is having worthwhile goals and accomplishing them relative to this. CHARACTERISTICS OF LOSERS 1) Interrupting work to answer the phone.</p>
            <p>2) Not learning a useful skill. 3) Punishing friends and being nice to enemies. 4) Bad manners, e.g., not thanking for gifts. — Readers Digest 5) Dressing inappropriately 6) Coming late for an appointment CHARACTERISTICS OF WINNERS 1) Maximizing the number of minimum (small guaranteed) gains, as opposed to big non-guaranteed gains (as in Game Theory). This is like Rabbi Nachman's way of learning quickly to gain as many small points as possible as opposed to learning one part of the subject really well</p>
