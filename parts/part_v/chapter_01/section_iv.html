            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>fallibility. I don't see why we should attribute to them something they didn't hold applied to them. (In fact, we see in the incident of Rabbi Eliezer that they didn't care if God himself held differently than them. Their job, as the saw it was to decide the law based on the majority opinion —whether that opinion was right or wrong just didn't matter. Yet, according to the Torah the majority opinion can be wrong (Leviticus 4:13) <sup>[14]</sup> : which, according to the Talmud in Shavuot is referring to the Sanhedrin of 71 elders permitting accidentally one of the 36 types of sin that involve being cut off. So the majority is the way to decide the law, not the way to discover truth.) The Talmud is a record of the Oral Law as it was discussed and debated at that time. The Sages don't need to be infallible in order to be deep and important just like Newton's Theory of gravitation was deep and fruitful even though it wasn't correct --but a necessary stage of development.</p>
            <p>We need to look at the New Testament and the Gemarah with historical retrospect and care, but also with respect. The 57 or so New Testament documents dug up in Egypt don't disagree on the basic facts of the life and teachings of Jesus. When we do this, a very clear picture of the Christian sect just being another sect besides the Scribes, Prushim (Pharisees) and Essences arises, who all had conflicting philosophies but were all equally committed to the Oral and Written Law. Now, to find the spiritual root of the argument between Sages of the Talmud and the Christians, since the universes of the Jews and the Gentiles are connected by a black hole, the Sages saw Jesus fall into the black hole, but remain on the event horizon — while from the point of view of Jesus and the gentiles, that's when he entered their space and the time of their correction began. Before that, Jesus simply could have gone back in time as in the Feynman diagram.</p>
            <p>You could conceivably have several manifestations of a tzadik (saint) at any one time, the one coming back (the 2nd coming is a constant process), and another that has already returned and going about preaching (as poor man and as the son of God coming on the wings of Heaven) (even conceivably as a good and bad one that meet at the bottom of the “v”and 8 each other and the soul of the tzadik-saint coming back through time losing entropy and the body going forward in time and their meeting and disappearing into pure energy, and then in that form transversing the realm of space-time until actually entering the black hole and disappearing from the Jewish scene, …so in essence I'm saying the dispute between the Christians and the Jews for the last 2000 years has been due to a lack of imagination). This is also how its possible for many people to have the level of Messiah the Son of Joseph through the soul of Jesus or the sparks of his</p>
