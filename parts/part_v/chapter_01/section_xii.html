            <p>Kabbalah anyway and the wrestling is the vessels of correction trying to contain the light of chaos until the dawn, i.e., the rising of the light of the name 72. I think the real explanation is that  first Yaacob had to fight God [good] and then evil Esau which is what every person has to go through in order to come to that level of God — beyond space-time and conception. For a person to come what he must come to he first has to fight evil, then he has to fight God, and then becomes a man. [There is a certain point a person needs to come to, a critical mass, so to speak, for him to start to wake up.] This is represented by the fact that God put the fiery angels before the path to Gan Eden. For one must go through Hell and Heaven to come to the Tree of Life .</p>
            <p>The angels try to stop one and then if they don't succeed they use their sword. God here also represents Being [the right sepherah Kindness], and Esau non-being [the left sepherah , lack of light]. Jacob had to fight both to come to “Becoming” [the middle sepherah , Yod He Vav He .] This is the significance of the wrestling, i.e., the joining of Jacob's level [right] with Esau's level [left] to come to the middle [Torah]. The reason Infinite God is sometimes manifested in finite space and time, as with Jesus, or in the Temple, or in other ways, is to give the finite intelligence of man some grasp of Him and thus to become attached to Him which is the purpose of man’s creation. Since there are five levels of man's soul, each manifestation of God is to give man a grasp of a higher infinity [as the difference between all the numbers between 0 and 1 and all the numbers between 0 and 2]. As the: 1.</p>
