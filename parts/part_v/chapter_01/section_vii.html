            <h3>Section VII</h3>
            <p>1. Egypt under Ptolemy Soter. 2. The Indian territories and part of Afghanistan which were given to an Indian ruler in return for military help. 3. The Seleucid Empire . 4. Macedon. This would imply that the next few verses would be referring to Jesus who was in fact at the latter time of the Greek Kingdom, after the Greeks were protected and freed by Roman decree [so at least they could be described as a kingdom if not an empire]. The verses later in Daniel 11 say openly that a messiah would arise during the empire that comes after the fall of the Greek empire and that could only be the Roman empire. The Talmud also says that the Messiah would come only when the Roman empire would spread over the whole world. Since the Talmud also says about Achashvairosh that his empire spread over the entire world would mean the whole known world at that time, this would imply that the messiah came when the Roman Empire was at its peak, not necessarily over the whole world, but the whole ‘known world’ at that time, which was during the rule of  Tiberius, when the Roman Empire reached its peak.</p>
            <p>The Roman Catholic Church isn't the equivalent of the Roman Empire, since it existed at the time the Talmud was written, and if the Talmud had meant the church it wouldn't have written ‘the government’ [‘Malchus Romi’, which translated means the government of Rome]. The whole story there in Daniel 11 seems to be clearly talking about Julius Caesar and Cleopatra, as has been noted before by the Jewish commentaries. And then, “AT THAT TIME”, the redemption comes. So it seems we have to conclude that the particular messiah it is referring to is Jesus, as Rabbi Abulafia already concluded in his kabbalistic way. [Daniel 9 also says that the messiah would come during the second temple period.] Faith in any saint has to be with understanding the true position and spiritual level of that saint. Otherwise, it is possible to fall from that faith. Therefore it is important to understand the place that Jesus takes amongst the other saints, and not to make it to seem that he was the only one that ever existed. This doesn't contradict the idea of the Trinity. It merely puts it into perspective.</p>
