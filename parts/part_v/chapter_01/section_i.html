            <h2>Chapter 1: Jesus Christ</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>The argument against Jesus is primarily based on the references in the Talmud against a certain Yeshu which was a common name at the time and the book “Seder Olam” refers to three Jesus's that lived at that time, and one that lived at the beginning on the second temple period who was the disciple of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Chananya. Historically, there was a famous Jesus also at the actual time of the Destruction of the Temple that used to walk around the city of Jerusalem predicting it's doom. The Tikunai Zohar also has a reference against Jesus. However, in all fairness it seems likely that the Zohar and the Gemara were in fact referring to Jesus and in fact didn't like him.</p>
            <p>Rabbenu Asher (the Rosh) writes at the end of Gittin that the Jesus mentioned there is not Jesus Christ. To say that the other places where that same person is mentioned in the Talmud are him would require a proof, of which there is none. In fact, the facts of the life of Jesus have been corroborated by at least 60 non-Christian documents, and none of the stories of the Talmud about Yeshu fit any of the facts about Jesus we are forced to admit that the Yeshu of the Talmud is not Jesus Christ, rather someone else at the beginning of the 2 nd -Temple period who was a disciple of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Perachiya, as the Talmud says, while Jesus Christ of Nazareth was born 400 years later.</p>
            <p>According to Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, Jesus is the Messiah son of Joseph -- a preliminary stage before the Messiah son of David, i.e., the sephirah of Foundation. The concept of a messiah from Efraim is brought in the Gemarah Zohar, especially in the works of Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato, and the Gra in Kol Hator (i.e., the sephirah of Foundation). (He [Rabbi Abulafia] also says things about the cross which would imply that Jesus didn't lose his high level of Messiah son of Joseph any time. Yet, he also says the verse “you shouldn't have a false god” applies to Jesus -- meaning that the church after him did fall into idolatry.) What is significant about the opinion of Rabbi Abulafia is that all the major kabbalists accept him as an authority. Rabbi Chayim Vital quotes him extensively in vol. 4 of Shaarai Kedusha, and Rabbi Moshe Cordovaro quotes his books all throughout the Pardes. The Chida (Rabbi Chayim David Azulai) has a section on him in Shemos Hagedolim, and concludes that he was in fact a great saint). (The fact that Rabbi Abulafia did write this about Jesus is easy to see for anyone who wants to take the time to go to the basement of the national library at Hebrew University and look at the microfilm copies of his books.</p>
