            <h3>Section XIII</h3>
            <p>3. The Chayot: “I the Chayot that I had see on the river Cevarand, on it was the Presence of God. (Chayot can mean animal in Hebrew). It refers to a type of angel that is the higher spirit of the animal kingdom. 4. Jesus. “Also, the Presence spoke through the mouth of Moses”. 5. God also spoke frequently in the Bible through an angel to reveal His Infinity to the highest level of man, the Yechida. One of the arguments I have heard against Jesus is that the three requirements of the Messiah were not fulfilled by him, i.e., the three requirements the Rambam gives: of building the Temple, returning all Israel to the 613 commandments, and gathering the dispersed of Israel.</p>
            <p>However we find that these things are the subject of a debate in the Gemara, Sanhedrin 98a. Rabbi Yochanan in fact says like the Rambam that all the promises of the prophets are for the days of the messiah while the higher spiritual world we can't comprehend. Shmuel says that all the promises are in fact for the higher spiritual world while the only difference between his time [under Babylonian rule] and the time of the messiah will be the subjection of the nations on Israel. That is in fact probably what would have happened if they had accepted the teachings of Jesus [since it was the hot headed nationalists then who provoked the wrath of the Romans and the subsequent exile. But any savior can't do his job unless he is believed in. Even Moses could do nothing with the many people that didn't believe in him, as the sages said that only 1/5 th or 1/50 th of Israel came out of Egypt since the rest God caused to die during the seven days of darkness, since they didn't believe in Moses.</p>
            <p>[So in a way, Moses brought a worse Holocaust on the Jewish people than the Nazis since the Nazis never got up to killing 88% or 98% of the Jewish people. So we see being a savior isn't enough. The people have to accept the savior. And if they don't, woe to them]. And if no one had believed, Moses in fact could not have saved anyone — as he told God his reason for not wanting to go, “They won't believe</p>
