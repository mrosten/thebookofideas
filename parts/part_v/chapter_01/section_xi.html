            <p>approaching. I don't mean that we can't approach Him directly because obviously we can, but rather that it helps to have a little help. Why else do we do the mitzvot ? Because God said to. Well, God also said about the angel he was sending before the Jewish people, “Don't disobey him for my Name is in him.” So here, God himself has indicated the significance of an intermediary. (“Other gods” are other levels not attached to the “rope of holiness”, i.e., that are not manifestations of God.) [In every generation, there were and will always be one part of the Torah that will be politically incorrect. The Rambam made a somewhat reactionist theology against Christianity but the simple way the sages look at the Torah is thus, as I have written. E.g., when they explained that God called Jacob ‘God’ as Rashi brings down in Genesis that would seem to go against the Rambam that you can't call a person God [the Raavad in fact disagreed with the Rambam and held that believing that God was or can be manifested in a body is not against the Torah].</p>
            <p>The Rambam obviously was embarrassed by many laws of the Torah that seem to go against reason, and he had to create a rationalization for them. Nowadays, other parts of the Bible bother us, e.g., when God promises to give the land of Israel to the children of Abraham and then Ishmael is born and God promises to Abraham that Ishmael will fear God. Now, slavery of the Bible is embarrassing to the Jews, and the fact that the Bible says you have to go to the rabbis to understand the Torah correctly is embarrassing to the Christians. Now, legally speaking, the slavery of the Torah is actually seldom, or indentured servants — because there are strict laws of how to treat a slave, and in fact the Russians were doing a lot better as serfs under the Tzar than when they were emancipated and toppled the Tzar and created a communist state.</p>
            <p>Now what was God doing wrestling with Jacob? If we say that was the aspect of God that contains evil then this is understood. Or just the opposite. Perhaps it was the good aspect of God fighting with the evil aspect of Jacob. For Jacob contained all the future Jewish souls many of which are not good. It could also refer to chaos and correction, i.e., God represents the higher world of chaos <sup>[63]</sup> and Jacob, correction <sup>[45]</sup> as it usually is thus in</p>
