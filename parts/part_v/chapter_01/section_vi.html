            <h3>Section VI</h3>
            <p>mother's side. Jesus quoted the Torah when tempted by the evil one, “The Lord Your God You shall fear and Him alone you shall serve.” It seems clear that Jesus believed one must serve God alone, not Jesus. The Torah also says, “There is nothing besides God.” Coming to this knowledge of the oneness and uniqueness of God -- loving him and fearing him and keeping His commandments -- is what the Torah defines as serving God. Because of the uncertainty principle, there will always be questions on Jesus or any saint that can't be answered. Like the fall of Rome, the crusades, the treatment of Galilio. If you believe in the Torah and the Talmud, there will be questions you can't answer either.</p>
            <p>The Gemarah in Avodah Zara (pg. 9) says that you shouldn't buy land outside of Israel after 470 AD, for the Redemption will have come already. It also says the Messiah will come when the Roman Empire has spread over the whole world — which means that the whole world known then (as they said about Achashveirosh, that he ruled over the entire world, which was only actually the Persian Empire). At any rate, the Roman Empire doesn't exist, so neither of these Gemarah's make sense unless they are referring to Jesus. (Besides this, Rabbi Abulafia said that the Gemarah in Sukkah regarding the Messiah son of Joseph that it  is referring to Jesus.) Jesus being a tzadik makes it allowed to ask him for a blessing just as with any Torah sage, as the Talmud says, “One who has someone ill at home should go to the Torah sage in his town to pray for him.” In another place in the Talmud, it says when a certain rabbi needed to be saved from his enemies, he went to the graves of his parents to ask them for help [not for their prayers but for their help].</p>
            <p>The Sages say that the reason the grave of Moses was not revealed is that if the Jewish people would know where it is and go there and ask him to pray for them that the final redemption would come right away. Daniel 8:22 has to be referring to Alexander the Great (of Macedon) since in the previous verse Daniel says the previous Empire was Media and Persia. This verse says the empire of Alexander would be broken into four parts. I would like to suggest that they are:</p>
