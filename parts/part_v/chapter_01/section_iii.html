            <h4>The Isaiah Discrepancy</h4>
            <p>The "Dead Sea Scrolls" and historical references suggest that certain verses of Isaiah—absent from the modern Masoretic text—predicted a Messiah who would be killed by the "Kittim" (the Romans) with the sanction of the high priest. This finding provides a missing link to the claims of Jesus and Paul, who referenced scriptures that no longer appeared in the common Bible of their day. Furthermore, the debate over the "Virgin Birth" often centers on the word *Almah* (young woman), which the Jewish commentator Ibn Ezra notes can equally mean "virgin." These historical and linguistic anomalies suggest that the Christian narrative is not a complete departure from the Biblical tradition, but a specific manifestation of its hidden potentials.</p>

            <h5>The 2000-Year Proof</h5>
            <p>If a spiritual system's validity is measured by its effects, Christianity has an undeniable record of taming violent civilizations and inspiring countless hospitals, orphanages, and acts of charity. This "Practical Verification" demonstrates that the name of Jesus carries a frequency of holiness that effectively tames the human animal.</p>

            <div id="panel-struggle" style="display:none">
            <h5>The Authority Crisis</h5>
            <p>While the Talmud possesses the authority to interpret the Law, the moral state of those who study it sometimes raises questions about its "Practical Validity." Unlike a physics experiment that yields the predicted result, the spiritual experiment of the Yeshiva often fails to produce the "Good Person" it promises, leading to a search for a more potent Divine inspiration.</p>

            document.querySelectorAll('input[name="verify-logic"]').forEach(radio => {
            radio.addEventListener('change', () => {
            const isStrug = document.getElementById('view-struggle').checked;
            document.getElementById('panel-success').style.display = isStrug ? 'none' : 'block';
            document.getElementById('panel-struggle').style.display = isStrug ? 'block' : 'none';
            });
            });
            </script>
            <h4>The Savior's Requirement</h4>
            <p>A savior's effectiveness is contingent upon the people's belief. Just as Moses could only save the small fraction of Israel that believed in him—leaving the rest to perish in the darkness of Egypt—Jesus could not fulfill the national promises of building the Temple or gathering the exiles because his own people rejected him. The failure to achieve the national messianic goals was not a failure of the savior, but a failure of the "Vessels" (the people) to receive the Light. Had the teachings of peace been accepted, the hot-headed nationalism that led to the Temple's destruction might have been avoided.</p>
            <div class="concept-box">
            <strong>The Change of Basis</strong>
            In the spiritual geometry of Emanation, the "Basis" of the Sepherah of Foundation was originally Joseph. With the advent of Jesus, a change of basis occurred—a new mapping where the four letters of Jesus's name (Yeshu) became the new vectors for the Light of Foundation. This was not a deletion of the old system, but a transformation of its manifold to allow for a broader outreach to the nations.
