            <p>kindness. But he was not a prophet, since he never claimed to have prophecy and never said, “Thus sayeth the Lord”. A prophet is connected to Victory or Splendor not to Foundation or Royalty like Messiah of Joseph or David. Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato in the Ginzei Haramchal, (pg. 246) seems to be referring to the aspect of the fall of Jesus to which Rabbi Abulafia also refers in which Jesus, became the subject of idol-worship of the church until the Reformation of Martin Luther. That part of the soul of Jesus (the lowest of the 4 parts) may very well have been in hell until the time Rabbi Chayim Vital saw him rise from hell. This is like part of the soul of Samuel which Saul spoke with.</p>
            <p>It is possible that Rabbi Abulafia is of the same opinion as Rabbi Moshe Chayim Lutzato that Jesus fell into the evil kelipot and that the Gemarahs about “that person” in fact refer to Jesus. That is the job of every righteous person to go into the klipot and to rise therefrom, so that by his rising he should bring all the sparks of holiness that have fallen there up with him. It is odd the Jews and Christians agree that Jesus went into hell. Their disagreement is on the duration of his visit and the purpose of it. They both are looking at the same event, but from different perspectives.</p>
            <p>The Sages must have seen Jesus going into a black hole which led to the separate universe of the Christians and never saw him arrive — just suspended in space but from the perspective of Jesus he went in and came out of the white hole on the other side. The root of Jesus is in the circular sephirot, therefore he is usually only accepted by non-Jews whose roots are also there. That is why Jesus is considered bad by Jews whose root is in the straight sepherot, for when they look at him they see him in an area which, relative to their position in the empty space is the klipot, but from the aspect of the circular sephirot it's the highest degree of holiness.</p>
            <p>Since Jesus was from Joseph his holiness is hidden, “as the fish in the sea” (the blessing given to Joseph) — and therefore the Sages of the Talmud didn't recognize his greatness. We find that Rabbi Akiva thought Bar Kochba was the Messiah, and he endorsed him. We find many places were the Sages admit their</p>
