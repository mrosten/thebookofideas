            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Christians “I testify that whether a man or woman, slave or maid servant, Jew or idol-worshiper, the Divine Presence rests on a person only according to his deeds” -Tana Deve Eliyahu, from Eliyahu the prophet. “For it is known that the souls of Israel are from the earth… but as for the non-Jewish nations whose souls are from Heaven, they need not perform deeds (613 mitzvot .)” -- The Gaon from Vilna (The Gra.)

But the support for the Baal HaTanya’s point of view is the fact that in the same letters are hinted the name Elohim with the yud filling the letters. Even though that is wholly important to note that it is the later permutations of that name which give rise to the Klipot, it seems to me that the root of non-Jews is the three names, “I Will Be” in the eye of Adam Kamdon, not actually the full names of 161 ,143, and 151 respectively, for in the full names there are no circular sephirot, [unless we are referring to the circular sephirot before Adam Kadmon].
