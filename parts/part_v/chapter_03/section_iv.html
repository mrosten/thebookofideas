            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>At first non-Jews had a soul from the outside of the klipah even their good inclination is from the klipah. But when they began to believe the one God they drew a higher holiness on themselves from their higher root. This applies to non-Jewish nations as a whole also, for every nation is like a whole person with some people representing the head and some the hands and others the heart and others the soul. The reason God brought Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart was to create music that would tie ones soul to the higher sephirah (divine trait). That is Bach - glory, Mozart - kindness, Beethoven - Judgment, Handel - Royalty.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, Beethoven did intend his music to be specifically ethnic which for Germany and Austria is the trait of judgment and it is only softened by the belief in Jesus but after they threw out Jesus in the 1860s the basic ethnic philosophy of Germany took it's place, i.e., war and conquest. The reason a non-Jew is not allowed to keep the Sabbath is that he is not effected by the Shabbos-field energy. Jews are affected only by the straight sephirot energy field, and non-Jews are affected only by the circular sephirot field.</p>
            <p>Each one of the 10 sephirot has its own energy field. There are certain sephirot that draw wisdom or children etc. And there are combinations of the fields of the sephirot that draw different combinations of blessings. A field is usually created or drawn by what one occupies himself with. So if one for instance learns math he will usually draw upon himself the math field energy. Kindness draws a kindness field. Learning Gemarah brings its particular field energy. Evil has its energy also. A place or country has its energy. Every day has its own energy. The reason to be by Rabbi Nachman on Rosh Hashanah is there is a certain energy field around a tzadik and every special day has it's own energy field. So on Rosh Hashanah when the two combine and there is created a electromagnetic oscillation by the presence of the chasidim, and a spiritual electro-magnetic wave is created.</p>
            <p>Many times one can't help what type of field is drawn upon him or how he will be affected by it. He can just try his best to do what is right. But general principles can fail in specific situations and therefore God has given us a certain intuition in the heart to be able to detect energy fields not seen by the eye or detected by the mind.</p>
