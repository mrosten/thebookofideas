            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Western civilization grew on the ruins of the Roman Empire, since, according to Rabbi Abulafia, the vertical part of the cross signifies Hebrew and the horizontal part Latin and Greek. Therefore Christendom which had to contain all these three elements in order to become Western civilization, is significantly different than the rest of the world which remains in the Dark Ages until they become westernized. Christianity just got too moral, and secularism just has got too immoral after Kant. Nowadays, we base laws on science which are unproven and unfounded and only barely out of the crib. Christianity has to first throw out all the laws of the Bible, as Paul said to do. Then they have to make up their own morality.</p>
            <p>Secularism first throws out the Bible, then logic and reason as per Kant . Then they have to find their own things to fight like tobacco. (I would guess that alcohol kills a lot more people on the road than tobacco but America found out then the wise statement of Einstein, “You can't make illegal what people are going to do anyway.”) I don't know the reason God forbade certain things in the Bible and permitted others, but I suspect He knew what He was doing. The path to knowledge for the Jew and Christian has apparently taken the long and hard paths. Getting out of religious thought and going to Aristotle and humanism seems to have done much more for knowledge in general. Yet Jesus and Baba Sali are also realities I must resort to the idea of drawing the light of the circular sephirot (humanism) into the vessels of correction (Jewish people) Jewish soul).</p>
            <p>In the opinion of the Meiri and the Rashba Christians aren't idol worshippers but in the category of gerai toshav [proseleties of the gates] . In the opinion of Rabbi Joseph Karo they are Gerai Hashaar (proselytes of the gate) which is on even a higher level than gerai toshav (proselytes of dwelling who have legal status and rights in Judaism though they aren't Jewish, since they keep the seven Noaide laws) Rabbi Yaakov Emden writes “Christianity has been given to the Gentile world by the Apostles as part of the Jewish religion and its founder has made the moral laws stricter than those contained in the law of Moses.” Rabbi Nachman said when one starts to come into the realm of holiness, judgements are awoken against him. Thus, you could explain the problems Rome had after</p>
