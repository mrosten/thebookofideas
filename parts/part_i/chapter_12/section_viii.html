            <p>reason Dinosaurs with larger brains never developed. Since the head and the heart are almost always in opposition, and heart is more in tune with the Divine, if you know what your head is saying but don't know what your heart says then do the opposite of the head. What makes sense -- don't do. The reason is if the heart and head were together then you would know what your heart says. Since you don't know there is therefore a conflict, and for sure your heart says something else and therefore it is not what the head says — but your head and logic are drowning out the message from your heart.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the naive among us hears a friend promise us some type of favor. “Come live in our house and all your needs will be provided.” We know why people take care of all the needs of chickens. It is not any altruistic ideal of benefiting the chicken. But when we receive the same invitation, we can be fooled. Here is how Zeno reacted to such a proposal. “And when Demochares, the son of Laches, embraced him once, and said that he would tell Antigonus, or write to him of everything which he wanted, as he always did everything for him, Zeno, when he had heard him say this, avoided his company for the future.” [] Learning is a Jewish principle. The importance of this is because the essence of life is to create.</p>
            <p>But how can one create something new if one doesn't take in and incorporate within himself something new daily? But not just anything new. The less one understands the better for as Swedenborg says, holiness dwells only in ignorance… This means, one should learn, not to know, but to fulfill he commandment of learning. Then, if knowledge does enter, it doesn't hurt since it is all on the level of ignorance — because one is serving God and attached to God to whom all knowledge is ignorance. Also, the knowledge one learns should not be man-made. It must be some explanation of how God's creation works. Engineering is OK, so is politics. But not man made laws, except if with the direction of discovering the “natural law”.</p>
            <p>Artificial sciences are called outer wisdoms by Rabbi Nachman and are harmful. [] Look at every obstacle as an opportunity in a different direction, i.e., instead of opposing the obstacle see if perhaps it is not just a subtle hint to do something different. It is not always a virtue to oppose evil. You have to know what you are up against. See the attitude of an Athenian general after Athens learnt a hard lesson from the disaster in</p>
