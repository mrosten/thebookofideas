            <h2>Chapter 12: Decisions</h2>
            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>Israel of Koznitz said a mitzvah that comes suddenly is usually from the evil side. In all these principles there are contradictions. So, I think the best thing is to make a hierarchy of advice principles. The first being if you know you are not capable of a correct decision then put it in God's hands. The irony of it all is that every attempt to bring Utopia to humankind seems to result in increased chaos and suffering. Why is it that the experts always seem to know the least and to be lacking common sense? This is not that people in general are all that much better. But the “experts” seem to have a knack for getting on the wrong track. When I was young, I was convinced that the reason for this was that experts are usually mediocre minds that have done the work to get where they are. Then, in their position of power, their inherent absence of talent manifests itself. This is probably correct.</p>
            <p>But I must change this idea. For my original idea was that all intelligence is one. This may be true but nowadays I think talent tends to be very selective. Even Leonardo Da Vinci had art and invention but no other fields. I used to say this was from lack of time to go into everything. But now I think it simply may be talent is selective. Of course, even after one has talent nothing can replace that spark of inspiration one needs from God. For this reason, I believe fear of God is important for creativity.</p>
            <p>To answer questions in life - no coin flips. No trying to get inspiration. There is: 1. First impression. 2. Basic feeling. 3. Doing the work to find out. Not people's advice. [There is enough in his Godliness for every creation. Be satisfied with what godliness he gives you.] The is the problem of listening to rabbis even though they may not be wise, perhaps puts one on the wrong track - or just reinforces the already wrong track that one is on.</p>
