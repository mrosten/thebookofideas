            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>The Greeks said know yourself. Perhaps meaning, “Know your lacks and your good traits. Then you can compensate. In place of lacks you can find friends that can do that part of your life that you can't take care of. In the good traits you will know what to concentrate upon.” Trust in God and simplicity. If you don't know something, then it is because Vesikin Vesikin God doesn't want you to know. If He wants you to know, he knows how to let you know. So, trust means do nothing until God shows you clearly His will. To trust in God, you need to learn to live with doubt until God solves the problem. But this is not automatic. Rather one needs actively to put oneself in God's presence and then I believe that God will take care of him.</p>
            <p>a. Reconnaissance. b. Independent Confirmation, [from a source other than yourself]. c. Be Prepared. d. Verify yourself if it really is like you heard or think. e. Bible. In America, people pay a salary to what is called a personal coach or someone whose job it is to get your life to be the best that it can be. This is what used to be a friend [or rabbi], but nowadays with that gone one needs to pay a personal coach. If that is a bit expensive a true friend is good to have. [So apparently the idea of advice from a friend or mentor is not a totally negative concept as I write in note {6}.</p>
            <p>Situational Awareness: This is something that fighter pilots need to stay alive. It is being aware of the whole situation around oneself, not just what is in front of us. This is the reason non-predators have their eyes on the side of their heads. [Predators have eyes in front of their head like people]. In life sometimes I am aware something is wrong in a certain place or situation, but I can't put my finger on it. So, to some degree I have this awareness but in general I have not acted on it, preferring to think everything is rosy and all people are loving. Well, they are not and if you sense something is wrong, head on out of there as fast as you can.</p>
