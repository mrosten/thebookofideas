            <h2>Chapter 12: Decisions</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>For Colonel Simons, the great principle was reconnaissance -- [check it out before you go in]. This was the difference between when he went in to rescue the hostages in Iran and being successful, while in a different rescue attempt by the army, it was unsuccessful. But in the frum world you hear things like Rav Sonenfeld getting married on the first one offered to him whether she would be proper or not. Maybe this was OK for him, but this isn't the same thing as trusting in God. Trusting in God means you trust in God, but you act to the best of your ability in each situation while knowing that the final result is in any case only dependent upon God's will.</p>
            <p>Is the “good” advice of some rabbis a trap to lead one to be their slave and give up on their free will? Or is it perhaps to lead one into an unproductive life? Why did all the frum/orthodox stay in Europe during the period of the Holocaust? Wasn't it because their rabbis who had generally given them good advice, advised them one time unwisely, i.e., not to flee when the Nazis rose to power?! From 1933 until 1939 why did almost no religious Jews flee from Poland? It is only because rabbis gave them good advice at various times, so they assumed that this time also would be so. Is what we call the Divine spirit of some rabbis a trap? [To lose one's free will? Why is it that when faced with a life decision you don't know which way to jump? Isn't it that slowly you have allowed the rabbis to take over your consciousness and now I can't get it back? So, life decisions I think must be made thus: a.</p>
            <p>Never ask advice from people or rabbis. For once you have heard it, it makes an effect even if you decide to reject it later - and every time you ask you give up a little bit of your free will. b. Never make a life decision under pressure emotional or sexual needs. c. Find a way to relax, like Winston Churchill who made most major decisions of World War II while lying in a bathtub. d. Like Barbara [a friend] said, “Find out.” Do the work necessary to find out the right course of action. Don't assume things.</p>
            <p>But my question is does this apply to a rabbi who has always seems to be right? Perhaps he really is wise?</p>
