            <h2>Chapter 1: God The Song Of God</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>Spinoza's Proof of God - mathematical The core of Spinoza's proof of God is that God includes existence in his essence and existence needs no cause because its essence is to exist (but God also has infinite attributes besides existence.) At any rate existence needs to exist only after it has some probability to exist which comes from the world of akudim which gives the wave function of the probability for the existence of the spiritual and physical universe. That probability function in itself has a cause, which has a cause etc., ad infinitum. This sequence of causes itself needs a cause etc., ad infinitum - vertically - until we get to God vertically and horizontally (ie. set of causes of the physical universe, set of causes of the spiritual universe, set of causes of the spiritual spiritual universe, etc.)  And this is the idea of God's infinite essences which are one with existence and the infinite series of causes, and the cause of the infinite series of causes, and the cause of the cause of the infinite series of causes etc. And then we are only dealing with the first type of infinity like the numbers between zero and one, or for whatever interval the universe was made in, but then we have to deal with the infinite types of infinite series of causes of the spiritual universes.</p>
            <p>Spinoza, by his proof of the existence of God, wanted to avoid the problems involved with defining God as being the first cause (for who says there has to be a limit to the number of causes) He didn't want God to be the first cause at all rather existence itself (or the essence of existence). The way he avoids the opposite conclusion is by the way he defines a true idea in the treatise on human understanding. According to that work lack of existence isn't a true idea or a true essence at all. However Hegel considers BEING to contain its opposite nothingness and by the contradiction that each concept contains its opposite comes to the more refined idea of Being i.e., Becoming which is what God meant when Moses asked his name and he said “I will be that which I will be” for the name Ehyeh means “I will be” and is the name of the highest sepherah in each world crown . This means that the real idea of Being is possible to come to only after an infinite progression of dialectic. This is the reason God is so hard to touch, since it really isn't accurate to say that he is since that is only the first approximation of describing Him. He is like dx which is not nothing but is infinitely small and thus contains two opposites, being and non-being. The end of Hegel's infinite progression is what I mean above by Existence.</p>
            <p>Spinoza'a proof is like the Henkin sentence which by asserting its own provability becomes provable. It has the ability to reflect on itself and thus logically proves the existence of God on the real level, not just in logic. It reaches out of itself like the strange loops that logic is filled with. Since Spinoza's system is consistent it has to reach out so to speak into another plane as all formal systems do -- just as number theory, in order to be consistent, has to postulate super numbers. Spinoza's proof of God is based on the basic idea that everything that exists either is self-causing or it is not. That which is, is defined as God. Now even though there is a possibility to say everything came from a quantum fluctuation, still if in fact that and the formulas involved with its creation came into being with no cause, that would be Spinoza's “Substance” or God. Only with the entirety of the Seven axioms do we get to God being one and infinite and indivisible. So the faith of the Torah is possible to prove but only if you have faith in the seven axioms of Spinoza, which correspond to the seven lower sephirot of Royalty .</p>
