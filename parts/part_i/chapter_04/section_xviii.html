            <p>is Judgement. The orthodox are Judgement, which is 10% of all Jews [However, a recent study shows the orthodox are about 7% of American Jews.] The Rashi that explains that people should not try to keep all the mitzvot [because if they would, then no one would merit to the next world] was written for those people who are not allowed to be religious, for being religious isn't their root and it is forbidden for them to try to be religious and it would hurt them spiritually if they would try. The Gemara in Macot 24A says, ‘Rabbi Simlai expounded : 613 commandments were said to Moses...</p>

However, this doesn't detract from the fact that Rashi wrote what he wrote. This does show however that even the Marsha understood Rashi as saying what it is obvious what he is saying. Isn't it clear that Rashi knew the verses of the Torah that say the Mitzvot are forever? Obviously, yes. So, we must say that Rashi held those verses apply only to the specific commandment that the verse is referring to there, e.g., if the Torah says the two loaves or the Shabbat are forever then we know that those mitzvot are eternal. But why doesn't it say this by other mitzvot? It must be that the other mitzvot are not eternal. [Otherwise, why say</p>
