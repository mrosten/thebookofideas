(The idea that everything turns into its opposite [as the Sages said in terms of the poor becoming rich and vice versa; “There is a wheel which is turning in the world.”] only applies on the level of the lower six sephirot, not the top three, so Science and Kabbalah tend to help one to rise out of the rat race .)
