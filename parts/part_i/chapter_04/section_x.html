            <p>world’s problems on the Jewish leaders and rabbis of each g eneration. They aren't engaged in hyperbole but a statement of fact. The relation between mitzvoth and prayer to physical deeds is parallel to the relation between logic and revelation which is parallel to the relation between trusting in God and action. Saints went to one side of the spectrum and philosophers went to the other. The path of the Rambam was to defer to logic when there was a difference between Reason and Revelation. It is my opinion that revelation [the Crown] is the main thing and Reason [Wisdom] is only to understand and apply revelation to real life situations. Thus, it comes out according to this that trust in God is the main thing and action is secondary.

Then when God sees that your spiritual vessels are ready, He will shine his light on you [The Guide III:52]. However, he says in connection with prophecy, that even after proper preparation, there is no guarantee that He will give you prophecy for the Rambam held that intuition is like IQ — it is a naturally born power, of which some people have more and some less — but everyone has to some degree [The Guide II:32 and 38].</p>
            <p>He held the prophets increased this faculty by learning. The Rambam obviously held that there is a point that what is internalized in the mind becomes part of the spirit — similar to Hegel. However, I think that by meditation, which</p>
