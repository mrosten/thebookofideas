            <p>reason is that sexual desire in itself is directed towards all females and thus is a manifestation of the spirit of the species as to increasing the quantity of the species, not the quality. [This idea is from Schopenhauer]. The reason that is evil is that simple continuation is kelipat noga, only going up and improvement relative to one's present position is good. For mitzvot that you don't feel light from you will not get any reward in the next world therefrom. There really is not all that much difference between here and there. So, if you don’t feel any light then believe me, there isn't any. This is why the Torah only promises good in this world for doing the mitzvot .</p>
            <p>Since the next world is not dependent on mitzvoth , only this world is. However, if you feel the light then in all likelihood you are on the right track for there too. However, since getting there is such a fragile thing it is worth it to have a guarantee. So, this is why it is worth it to get to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, say the ten psalms and give a penny for charity, in which case he promised he would take that person that does this out of hell, an unpleasant place by all accounts. It is forbidden to change one ’s religion since it is impossible to get the spiritual blessing except from the root one was born from as already mentioned by the kabbalists from the Middle Ages. But there is another reason, i.e., that religion is the images and stories e mbedded into one's consciousness when he is young. One can never change that, nor is it desirable to. One can always stick with his own religion and just take out the things that are forbidden. True religion isn't a bunch of rules, it is a way to approach God. And that can only be done with the totality of one's consciousness.</p>
            <p>Fear of God is being aware of the presence of God and fearing Him. It is not the same</p>
