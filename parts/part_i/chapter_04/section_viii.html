[It seems it works like a RLC circuit.] Fear of God is the key to wisdom, but many times the fear of God of the parents results in the wisdom of the children. Other times depending on its strength it causes the person that has it to be wise. University professors will in general have religious parents which resulted in their children being wise.</p>
            <p>Since Fear of God is such a key factor in wisdom and besides that we have.

They discovered that outwardly religious people, whether Jewish, Protestant or Catholic, were less likely to become medically disabled, than those who didn't attend church or synagogue. A study of 454 men and 85 women in Jerusalem showed that secular [non­religious] Jews had a greater risk of heart disease than Orthodox Jews. Analysts from the University of Florida found that counties in the USA with the highest number of religious people have the lowest rates of cancer. Dr. Larson and his colleagues did a study on 400 men in Georgia, found that people that believed in God and attended religious services had the lowest readings of blood pressure.</p>
            <p>Those that had one or the other had higher levels. Those with neither had the highest readings. Dr. Larson and his team also reviewed more than 200 studies on religious commitment and mental health and found that religious people have</p>
