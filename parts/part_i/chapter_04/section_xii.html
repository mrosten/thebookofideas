            <h3>Section </h3>
            <p>orthodox Judaism all the prayers are exactly like that, and if one even attempts to put a little extra into his prayers, he is looked down upon and all the more so if he tries to pray with the intentions of the Kabbalah. [Nowadays, Orthodoxy has become an anti-spiritual movement]. Historically, I believe we can trace a long progression of Orthodox Judaism attempting to take spirituality out of the Torah. No longer is God a weighty subject in Judaism. Now it is the Laws [halacha] for the orthodox, or social justice for the Reform — but God simply has become a concept that is mentioned for the sake of lip service.</p>
            <p>Thus, we see that the Sanhedrin in the days of Moses tried to convict him for being a false prophet [Korach and the heads of the Sanhedrin as Rashi says]. Thus, we find the Torah establishment of David's time siding with Saul — as the Gemara Shabbat explains [Doeg was the head of the Sanhedrin]. Thus, we find most of the rabbis of the Rambam's time trying to excommunicate him, and thus we find the rabbis of later times condemning the Kabbalah. In all these cases a generation has to go by, and sometimes much more, until the truth is accepted — but by then it is sterilized, so as to become non-effective.</p>
            <p>Now, all of them are considered great, but their teachings are ignored when they aren't politically correct.  Physical mitzvot, to the Rambam, are to provide an environment for spiritual growth, but do not cause it. Physical actions can in no way stimulate internal growth. If knowing lots of laws makes one spiritual, then Big Blue the computer is more spiritual than all the rabbis together! In yeshivot, it is the accepted way to delve deeply into every word and letter of the Rambam. I wonder when they will get around to delving into the exact meaning of “Consequently he who wishes to reach perfection, must first study Logic, then the different parts of Mathematics in their right order, then Physics, then Metaphysics”! — and be exacting in every word and every letter.</p>
            <p>It is a very worthwhile experience not to get your prayers answered so that you realize that your prayers and trusting on God and your good deeds can't cause God to do your will. This is the case no matter how powerful and deep your prayers are. It is a big ego trip to think that with your prayers you can force him to do your will. Trust and prayer are good things when done with the right viewpoint - that God will do what he knows to be the right thing no matter what. But prayer also can help but only sometimes.</p>
            <p>There are two ways of approaching tolerance:</p>
