            <h3>Section VII</h3>
            <p>of the Talmud said the first Chasidim used to wait one hour before and after every prayer. Then it was asked in the Gemara, “Then for the three prayers every day it comes out to be nine hours. When did they learn anything? The Gemara answered, since they were Chasidim [i.e., pious] their learning was guarded / blessed inside of them. To the person that said “ guarded ” it was only guarded. To the person that said blessed, their learning was actually increased.” Now it is clear that they weren't praying or learning but meditating. [Since the main problem in meditation is the discipline needed, I suggest taking an oath to sit and do it for a certain amount of time. An oath is a powerful tool because it turns a motivation to do a good thing into a motivation not to transgress a very serious sin which is stronger.</p>
            <p>The idea of oaths was given by the Torah to help the weak of spirit . Incidentally an oath should only be taken day by day, never for more than that since, “Who knows what tomorrow may bring?” The Brit Menuchah mentions that Prophecy comes from the Tzitz of the Cohen Gadol which is representative of the sepherah of the crown and comes only through the path of judgment . And this helps to answer Nietzsche’s objection to the saints of old that afflicted themselves to come to some spiritual levels. Rabbi Nachman also mentions this in Likutei Moharan, Vol.</p>
