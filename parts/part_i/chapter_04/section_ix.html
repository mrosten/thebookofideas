Young people who are religious also do better in school and are less likely to be sexually active. Married people that are religious reported greater marital happiness, more satisfaction with their sex lives and lower rates of divorce. The researchers examined specific concrete behavior like attending services, not just abstract belief. [From the book Age Erasers for Men by Doug Dollemore Rodale Books, Pennsylvania, 1994]. This certainly doesn't seem like Saint Frances of Assisi who held that you can't live a lifestyle of peace and own material possessions and still be called a Christian at all.</p>
            <p>However, I think fear of God has to be entered into with a willingness to do what is required regardless of the consequences — but the end result in general is that of peace and happiness. We find Haran burned even though Abraham was saved because Abraham was willing to be thrown in the furnace regardless of the consequences. Thus, was saved. Haran was willing to be thrown in only because he thought he would be saved. Since the Jewish people do not have the surrounding light of the circular sephirot their only evil is in community actions [actions that can be ascribed only to the community at large] like acquiescence to evil that their leaders and rabbis do, but individually they are righteous.

[This is why Christian Evangelists can do miracles only in large groups where all the collective prayers and faith join together to draw the soul of Jesus, while individual Jewish saints generally can do only private miracles.] This is the reason why the Jewish people can't make a nation at peace even within itself much less with the Arab world surrounding it since they lack that outer light. This is the intention of the prophets when they prophesied that the Jewish people would have bad leaders as a result of their sins, i.e., the prophets saw the outer light would be taken from them and replaced by klipot so that the actions of the Jewish people as a whole would be evil though individually each person would be righteous. This is also the intent of the Zohar when it refers to “Rabbis that are Jewish demons ” . And this is the intent of the Sages when they blame the</p>
