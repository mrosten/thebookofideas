            <h3>Section IX</h3>
            <p>Since the Jewish people do not have the surrounding light of the circular sephirot their only evil is in community actions [actions that can be ascribed only to the community at large] like acquiescence to evil that their leaders and rabbis do, but individually they are righteous. That is why punishment comes upon them usually as a group as in the Holocaust, but individually their fear of God brings them blessing physically mentally and financially and in their children. The Christians on the other hand are collectively righteous as in America while individually they are usually coarse Goyim. [This is why Christian Evangelists can do miracles only in large groups where all the collective prayers and faith join together to draw the soul of Jesus, while individual Jewish saints generally can do only private miracles.] This is the reason why the Jewish people can't make a nation at peace even within itself much less with the Arab world surrounding it since they lack that outer light. This is the intention of the prophets when they prophesied that the Jewish people would have bad leaders as a result of their sins, i.e., the prophets saw the outer light would be taken from them and replaced by klipot so that the actions of the Jewish people as a whole would be evil though individually each person would be righteous. This is also the intent of the Zohar when it refers to “Rabbis that are Jewish demons”. And this is the intent of the Sages when they blame the world’s problems on the Jewish leaders and rabbis of each generation. They aren't engaged in hyperbole but a statement of fact.</p>
            <p>The relation between mitzvoth and prayer to physical deeds is parallel to the relation between logic and revelation which is parallel to the relation between trusting in God and action. Saints went to one side of the spectrum and philosophers went to the other. The path of the Rambam was to defer to logic when there was a difference between Reason and Revelation. It is my opinion that revelation [the Crown] is the main thing and Reason [Wisdom] is only to understand and apply revelation to real life situations. Thus, it comes out according to this that trust in God is the main thing and action is secondary. Thus, people from the different faiths that chose separation from this world as the proper path would be going according to this logic, and in fact it seems that their great devotion to God resulted in their gaining some kind of closeness with him [Baba Sali or Saint Frances of Assisi]. I have heard that Rav Sonnenfeild from Jerusalem decided as a young man that he would take the first match offered to him and thus he did depending on God divine providence that she would be the right one. And in fact, they had a long happy marriage. Yet I would agree with that only in conjunction with the advice of George Fox of then taking advice from one's family. This would be in accordance with the principle of the sephirah of the Crown first [trust], then reason [Wisdom].</p>
