            <p>person to hold on to the lessons of the Baal Shem Tov. The Baal HaTanya created a different path which I consider to be valid but certainly not related to Chasidut. For example, the Baal HaTanya deemphasized the importance of the “rebbi ” which the Besht held was essential. Also, the Besht gave the path of when one sees a beautiful girl to raise the trait of Beauty to its higher root, which the Baal Hatanya dismissed for people in general. The idea of “There is nothing besides God” of the Baal Hatanya is also different from the Besht. To the Besht it is like Shankara, i.e., literally nothing but God. Everything is God. There is nothing but his infinite Light. But to the Baal Hatanya everything is “as if it is nothing and nullified like a ray of light in the sun.” There is a whole book in the Yeshivat HaKotel which goes further into the discrepancy between the idea of the Oneness of God of the Besht and the Baal Hatanya which I just skimmed over. What I wrote is from my own understanding of this, but that book went much deeper. The other things I mentioned are in some article in the Library of Hebrew University.] Doing the unifications of the Ari means to go to a quiet place and to concentrate on God and his Divine names. It is the same idea as the meditation of the Bhagavad Gita except that the Gita just talks about concentrating on the Oneness of God while the unifications of the Ari give vessels to contain the light in.</p>

Rabbi Chayim Vital writes in the introduction to the Eitz Chayim, “The dull person who can't understand the Talmud after having tried it should leave it and learn only Kabbalah,  however a smart person is required for one or two hours a day to the study of Halacha and to intend to answer the questions that fall upon the Halacha, and afterwards he should intend to dress the bride - which is the Wisdom of the Kabbalah.” The Ramchal writes along the same lines in his books. The age of forty for Kabbalah isn't mentioned by any major authorities and only brought as an anonymous “some people say” in the Shach. However, the Rambam does say to be filled with Talmudic learning before learning Kabbalah which, the Shelah HaKadosh says, means to fill yourself with Talmudic learning “that day”, before you learn Kabbalah.</p>
