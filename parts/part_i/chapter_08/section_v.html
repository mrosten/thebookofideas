            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>sun really is ready to rise it is already so bright that it is almost irrelevant if you can see the sun or not. When the whole world will be filled with the brightness and glory of God then I will know that messiah is near . Until then I will just have to wait. Since in every level of creation there are two Strange Loops : o ne that takes one up and the other that takes one down to the lower level [like the double helix of the DNA], thus, to come to the redemption one needs to find the Strange Loop for the present level. But the present level consists of ten sephirot.</p>
            <p>For instance , t he religious level has this strange loop that t he more you get into it the more you find it implies Jesus, but Jesus in the New Testament said things contradictory to the Torah, at least on the face of it. But then again, he said keep the whole Torah with exactitude. This works for all saints also. Like getting involved with the Gra or Rabbi Nachman will inevitably lead to self-contradictions. This may seem to lead in circles but in fact they lead to the next higher level.</p>
