            <p>Torah), not chasidut, not Musar, not Halacha, not Gemara, etc. Others have different answers to bring the redemption. Nothing has helped and still the redemption isn't here and still the sole and single advice of Rabbi Chayim Vital isn't done. He wrote that 500 years ago and it's still not done. All the Musar and Chassidus and Halacha haven't helped. Maybe Kabbalah is dangerous but nothing else has done better. And still the one simple piece of advice of Rabbi Chayim Vital isn't done - learn Kabbalah all day and the redemption will come.</p>
            <p>If we don’t it’s clear that the redemption won't come (t his section refers to the spiritual redemption not the political one even though they are in fact closely related for no matter how much political progress is made if it isn't coupled with God, it has little worth as America is proving so well nowadays as it rapidly sinks into totalitarianism). As to the idea of drawing the light of that coming period closer which problem is on the mind of many, I have a few suggestions : 1.)

Abulafia was born Rosh HaShanah of that year) (Khan took Kiev that year and was well on his way to severely shake up all Christendom and the Islamic empires and China. His progress was halted in (of all places) the land of Israel! It is interesting to note that the Rambam writes that prophecy would be restored to Israel at that time. It seems to me that Rav Acha was referring to the emergence of the Renaissance and the Kabbalah at that period.</p>
            <p>3.) Rabbi Eliezer said the days of the Messiah will be 40 years (Sanhedrin 99a). If we go by the 6000 year opinion that means Messiah will come in the year 2200 AD., [about 200 years from now ]. 4.) Rabbi Chiya son of Aba said in the name of</p>
