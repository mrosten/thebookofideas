            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>Rabbi Yochanan, “all the prophets prophesied only for the days of the Messiah, but as for the next world no ‘ eye has seen it ’ , and this disagrees with Shmuel for Shmuel said , “ there is no difference between this world and the days of the messiah except for enslavement of Israel to the nations.” Shmuel is saying that all the prophecies of the Bible about the days of the Messiah are referring to the time of the revival of the dead and don ’ t refer to this world at all at any point. [That is the same spiritual realm where the stories of Rabbah Bar Bar Chanah took place.] This is clearly the intention of the Gemara which says that Rabbi Yochanan and Shmuel disagree. This would mean that the Temple and the gathering of the exiles all refer to the higher realm. This would correspond the prophecies of Yechezkeil that the return from the Babylonian exile was the final redemption and that in the higher spiritual plane there already exists the Temple and all the souls of Israel are in the higher land of Israel. This would answer the question on Rav Hillel for the prophecies that took place after Hezkia the King were referring to the higher world. This would explain the Zohar that the Gates of the Higher and Lower Wisdom would be opened up in the year 5600 (about 1840) by which time all the major saints of the Jewish people were gone, e.g., Rabbi Nachman, the Baal Hatanya, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzaira etc. Rather the intention is that in this lower world the Gates of the Lower Wisdom and in the higher world the gates of the Higher Wisdom would be opened up.</p>

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said, 365 years, which puts it around the birth of Albert Einstein and Rabbi Israel Abuchatzera. 7.) Rav Hillel says, “There will be no Messiah for Israel, for they already enjoyed it [that period] in the days of Chezkia” (Sanhedrin 99-A). 8.) “The redemption of Israel will be like the rising of the sun” [Midrash], i.e. , slowly but surely, and during that period it gets so light that you think the sun will rise in a minute when in reality it is still very far away.
