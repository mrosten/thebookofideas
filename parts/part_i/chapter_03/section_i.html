            <h2>Chapter 3: The Song Of Philosophy</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Philosophy [MR1] [MR2] The ultimate purpose in the creation of the world is the revelation of the oneness of God. One central method of its accomplishment is by the universal trait of reciprocity, i.e., the idea behind “what one gives is what one receives.” By the active “rewarding” of truth and goodness, and the “punishment” of evil, the oneness of God is revealed. This happens in every society, in every level of existence. This process can also be seen as the sifting out of the bad and bringing up the good to be included in the oneness of God.</p>
            <p>This principle results in infinite chaos depending on any slight variation in events. How the chaos here results in the oneness there is not known in detail—an element of it may be what the sages have said: that the good suffer in this world as punishment for their sin's which they have committed in this life time or in previous life times so that when they get to the next world they can receive the undiluted light of God with their loved ones, and the end result of good being rewarded does not happen until the next world where the oneness of God is revealed.</p>
            <p>Because of the compassion of God, He created the world. For he wanted to reveal His compassion, and there was no creation on whom would He have to show his compassion. Therefore he made everything from the top of Emanation to the center of the earth for this purpose,” — Lekutai Moharan The idea of the creation of man is for the expression of the goodness of God. For there was a basic lack in the Divine traits before the world was created — the lack of the revelation. This may tie in with Hegel’s idea that each trait implies its opposite.</p>
            <p>Another way of understanding the “lack” in each trait in itself is that as long as it is not being, it is lacking the quality of being used. <sup>[9]</sup> This understanding leads one to assume that the Divine traits  creations, but essential aspects of God. For example, to correct the two deficits of goodness and wisdom there was created the circular sephirot and the straight sephirot.</p>
