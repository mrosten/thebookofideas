            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>are the two outer vessels that contain free thought; they correspond to Chaya and Yechida . Reason and revelation (i.e., the heart) should be able to work together but when there is a disagreement, then obviously one of them is wrong. Reason then reigns usually tends to win out, and the intuition or revelation is left in the spiritual universe. The dichotomy of universities and religion (reason and revelation) is the dichotomy between chaos and correction , and the goal is to bring the light of chaos into the vessels of correction. Rabbi Nachman and the Rambam disagreed whether logic is subjected to revelation or visa versa, but in fact there is no disagreement. Each has its own area where it is qualified to judge.</p>
            <p>The spirit can only reveal things that are of the spirit. There is nothing but God, so He permeates and is unified with the physical and spiritual universe so God's presence in the physical universe is subject to logical proof which is what Spinoza does. But he can't go beyond that into the spiritual realm which works with mathematical principles but isn't subject to proof. That is the result of the original condensing in which God removed the revelation and proof of his presence from the empty space, and only as we progress through time does God reveal his presence and proof of his Presence one level at a time — as Rabbi Nachman comments on the empty space and relates levels of revelation to the outer makifim (fields) in which one level at a time enters humanity. So at least Spinoza got the first step.</p>
            <p>“It takes many years of sifting through false teachers to find a wise one. Don't be so fast to give up the wise teachers of history for they have been sifted from millions of false ones and their teachings have stood the test of the ages.” (Greenfield). The Bible the Sutras, the Talmud, Jesus, and Socrates may seem to contradict but in fact each sees a different aspect of and points to the same truth. Each were digging up the building blocks of the final structure. (Not to say that the structure is ever finished) Some people are content to poke around the stones, and others to try to knock down someone else's stone I think it is wiser to assemble them into one great building and then to ride the elevator to the top to see further.</p>
