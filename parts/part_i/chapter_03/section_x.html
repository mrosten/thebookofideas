            <h2>Chapter 3: The Song Of Philosophy</h2>
            <h3>Section X</h3>
            <p>The idea of the creation of man is for someone for God to do good to. There was a basic lack in the divine traits before the world was created. This lack was not in the higher traits themselves but in the Royalty (the lowest) of the Infinite one, i.e., in the revelation of the traits. So, God had to create man in order to have someone to do good to: and the highest good is God himself. But, how can man have any connection with God himself!? So, God created Free Will, so that man could choose God —this by choosing good from evil — and thus have a connection with God — based on his own deeds and words, thoughts and desires — not based on a free hand-out. This is in itself on the level of Royalty, which needs to receive, and that was the problem in the 1 st place. But now, man has united Royalty with the higher trait of giving, by choosing God, and not needing a free-handout to receive his reward of the light of God based upon his merits.</p>
            <p>This is based on the Ramchal, together with the beginning of the Eitz Chayim, and the Lekutei Moharan — but with a bit of integration. The idea is: God fills all worlds and surrounds all worlds — so one must unite the sparks of holiness in everything with the infinite presence of God himself by choosing God in everything he does, says, or thinks, or desires — and thus uniting himself and all creation with God. When one is united with God than he too can create Godliness, and this is the 1 st commandment in the Torah of being fruitful and to multiply, and children and ideas, and music.</p>
            <p>The contradiction between absolute knowledge and free-will is that God knows what one will cho ose not just from the future but from now (ie. not just because He knows the future). This contradiction is the root of Quantum Mechanics. Ideas are wave functions that travel at the speed of light and have all the characteristics of a quantum wave. That's why it's important not to think about your enemies badly so that your s and theirs wave function doesn't mutually interfere and just darkness is left. Don't send your waves in that direction at all, for their waves can't bother yours at all unless you do.</p>
