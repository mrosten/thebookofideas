            <p>get to the first cause you come to God. Thus, there is a creator and he is one. Now, since time and space may curve in on themselves, we could say that the number of causes is finite but keeps going around in a circle. But that still is not an objection since we are still thinking in a time loop going around in a larger time space.  The point is we still are reduced to cause and effect which has to have a limit. Hegel limits the number of causes in a different way. From two opposite concepts he goes to a more central concept, and so on, until he gets to God by encircling Him and narrowing down the range of the circle by his system of dialectics.</p>
            <p>That is actually different than my way of a long line of causes and finding God at the end. Hegel uses dialectics like a Mobius Strip which starts at one side and ends up on the other side. Thus, he limits the number of causes by encircling the first cause. Hegel considered the array of logical contradictions in logic to be like the Mobius Strip that reduce two sides to one and eventually narrows down all truth to one point. The idea of my proof is different for I am saying that Kant admitted that the Spinozian proof of God did prove Him, but only in the world of the mind and logic. What about Reality? I showed that if we admit to a world of reality besides the mind then we have to admit that at least one law works there -- that of cause and effect. And once we get to that we have proved God in the world of reality also.</p>
            <p>At any rate, I am using the idea of the Strange Loop in my proof having one level refer to another level and so on till we get to God by a progression from the physical universe to the spiritual one, until we get to infinite spirituality, which again reconnects to the physical universe. This explains my idea of Free Will in the section on Happiness -- which I would call the strange Spiral. Thus, just like if we postulate that the system of natural numbers is complete, we have to assume existence of super numbers. So, if logic is complete, we have to assume the existence of a super logic. This supper logic, if we assume it is complete, we have to assume the existence of a super logic etc.</p>
            <p>To Hegel, by dialect, one can come to knowledge, by an infinite progression of dialect until one comes to the Absolute. [ Dialect is the process by which every logical reality is shown to be implicitly self-contradictory and thus imply the need for a new, wider category that contains them and resolves them until one comes to the Absolute Idea. So, if we take the limit as the dialect approaches infinity, we get to God. Aristotle's proof of God is that even if we would</p>
