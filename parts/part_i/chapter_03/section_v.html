            <p>, b ut the idea of God's oneness is that the One God created everything and controls everything. The idea of the Torah that : “ There is nothing besides Him [God]” is that only God has true existence and everything else derives its existence from him constantly. Gods being one has to mean one substance, not one quality or quantity because if He is one quality and one quantity then he is by definition already two things. When the Torah says God is one, it doesn't mean continuous since then God would be divisible. If one means indivisible -- it says that nothing exists besides God since everything is included in or part of his Godliness -- then nothing can have quality or quantity. If it means the essence of God is one, and the essence of everything is God, then to be good or evil is the exact same thing! Rather it is like I said above -- the intention of the Torah is that there is a Creator and that creator is one, the one cause of existence. These arguments I got from Aristotle (in his Physics) who used them to refute the idea that all being is one.</p>
            <p>Idea - Coming to Absolute Knowledge: Rabbi Nachman held that absolute knowledge is possible only by revelation . And if one lacks that, then he can depend on faith. H e held that there is some point that the human mind can't cross in order to come to absolute knowledge without faith. Rabbi Nachman believed that one can come to faith by prayer. It seems that in this, Kant and Rabbi Nachman agreed -- that by pure reason, a-priori knowledge is not possible. This seems to be vindicated by Quantum Mechanics for, as in quantum mechanics, the reality we perceive is affected by our perception of it.</p>
            <p>Reason then, would be needed for the clarification of revelation. It is clear that reason has a higher place than faith in Rabbi Nachman's schema, as the first chapter of the Likutei Moharan makes clear. But to come to make that final step to God, even with</p>
