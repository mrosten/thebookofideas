            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Punishment Doing the mitzvot physically only brings physical blessing as the Torah says, “I will give rain in its season”. Only doing the spiritual essence of the mitzvot brings spiritual blessing and enlightenment. “Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house hath once been shaken from heave, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life… by folly in speech, and frenzy at the heart. Evil seems good to him whose mind the God draws to mischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.” - Sophocles in Antigone (i.e., any person with judgements upon them tends to do evil things almost against their will just so that the evil judgements will have something to come upon.) Rabbi Issac Luria says that the generations from Adam to Noah who were evil were reborn at the time of the flood to receive their punishment in this world. They were 600,000 root souls. The generations before the dispersion and the tower of Babylon were those same souls and had sinned during that ten-generation period.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the generations before the destruction of the 1 st Temple. And similarly, the generations before the Holocaust. And in the opinion of Rabbi Luria even if one was sinful in a prior life, once born again, he won't suffer for those sins if he lives properly. As the Zohar says about Job -- he wouldn't have suffered if he had brought peace offerings (parts of which are divided amongst the poor) instead of burnt offerings. This is even though he was Terach (who was an idolator) in a previous life. And that is why Rabbi Luria also says that he wouldn't have suffered if he had gone to Abraham to learn the ways of loving kindness. If we go by the opinion of Rabbi Luria, we will have to conclude that being religious isn't the same as being righteous for Job was religious, but he wasn't concerned enough about the poor to be righteous. In Hebrew, this is the difference between being righteous and being a saint.</p>
            <p>If you knew all that you need then you wouldn't have free will. So, God makes sure you</p>
