            <p>don't. Your true character can be revealed only when you don't know all the facts about your situation and how your actions affect events, and you must decide anyway how to act. But when one correctly knows the situation then he has no free will, and thus no reward and punishment and is just a clay in the hands of the artisan. But still the revealing of the traits doesn't happen in his way. And the free will was made for there to be the revealing of one's character traits. However even those totally in Yiddishkeit or Jesus or science, God seems to make sure that many things ever that are not known which can easily be seen by others so that there should still be free will in these things.</p>
            <p>People's impression that big things happen in their lives because of very small things is true as the formula: [IMAGE: image001.gif] tells us, i.e., that a small variation between certain numbers can cause substantial changes. But eventually one comes down from the world of chaos into the world of probability where things average out into a nice binomial function - farther from the light but closer to the vessels that can hold whatever light one may have. The reason there is suffering before each new level of wisdom is that the sephirot of Akudim before they reach a higher level must turn their backs to face upward, so the higher light comes through their backs. Then, as they reach the higher level, they turn around again to face forward to us and there is a higher revelation of light but during the time they were rising there was only the backward light (red shifted).</p>
            <p>There have been people that accomplished great good in the world yet suffered enormously as a result of it. This is because the higher light comes dressed in judgements. Nietzsche held that according to the Bible, God saves the righteous, period. No ‘ifs’, ‘ands’ or ‘buts’. Yet I have a way of answering for the Sages. [The opinion of the Sages is that God rewards those who have a majority [in quality] of sin with good things in this world and punishes their sins in the next. This is to reward</p>
