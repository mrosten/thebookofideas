            <h2>Chapter 10: Gemarah</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud’s There are different ways to understand the Talmud. There is the looking-to-be strict way and there is the looking-to-be lenient way. Both are valid (i.e., some people learn to find ways of being stricter and some to be less strict — and both are valid because as the Talmud says, “God said to do, so no matter how we do it, it’s ok with Him.” — as long as one is trying to do the right thing. I would like to add that actually there are millions of valid ways to learn the Talmud.</p>
            <p>To give some examples there is the going deeper and deeper into its infinite logic, and there is doing the same with Rashi and Tosphot. But there is also going into the length and breath as the commentaries tend to do. Then there is the Kabbalistic way and the Halachic way. The halachic way is divided between the Rambam who didn't assume all the Talmud has to have one parallel line of thought and the other authorities who held that it did. (They held one place can't disagree with another based on the “ stame de gemara ” — but the Rambam didn't agree, because that is for the original compilation of Rav Nachman Bar Issac, not the final version of Rav Ashi and Ravina who collected all the pieces). There is also the way of Reb Chaim to find the deeper principles. I had my own way for a while to find all the conflicting principles in every subject and reduce them down to one final principle, but I never finished it.</p>
            <p>My model of the Gemarah is not open from the outside (like the non-religious), but open from the inside, — i.e., to go into the deeper dimensions. So instead of the flat way, I want to open up the 4th dimension of the Talmud so that everything it says should be invariant only if you look at it from the spiritual way, not the flat way. The Oral Law was written down during the second Temple period in documents of the Scribes (professional rabbis), the ultra-orthodox (the Prushim) and the Essenes. After the destruction of the Temple, the long arduous process of collecting, sorting out and arranging the discussions and decisions in the countless documents and oral traditions before the Yeshivot in Babylon and Israel began. The Talmud is a work of the genius of many generations after the destruction, compiling and evaluating the laws handed down by those groups.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the Talmud itself doesn't present a question on Jesus since it was meant to</p>
