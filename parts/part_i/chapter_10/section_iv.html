            <h2>Chapter 10: Gemarah</h2>
            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>Kal Vechomer (a conclusion from a minority) is a law to Moses on Mount Sinai, but it is from heaven as is everything which comes from the 13 ways to explain the Torah, (as the Rambam says in Moreh Nevuchim), for there are many places in the Talmud where how to apply any one of the 13-principles is a subject of debate (i.e. if you can prove a law from one of the 13 principles then it is Biblical). The Gemarah in Sanhedrin (99a) says, “Even if one says the whole Torah is from Heaven except for one verse that God didn't say rather Moses said it himself is in the category of “he has despised the word of the Lord”, and even if he says the whole Torah is from heaven except for some derivation or some a conclusion a minority or some derivation from similar expressions is in the category of “he has despised the Word of the Lord”. If this would mean every time a derivation is said in the Gemarah that it was said to Moses at Mount Sinai then all the Talmudic sages would be in that category, for the Talmud is full of arguments on the application of the 13 principles. Rather this means that anything proven by the 13 principles is from heaven, not that it's a tradition from Moses on Mount Sinai. [On Biblical verses the Gemarah says God said them to Moses, but on derivations it says they are from heaven.] (Also, the laws brought back by the derivations, not the recollections of Yonasan Ben Kenaz would have been rabbinical, not biblical.) Rashi is clear in Brachot 5b that the mishna was not given on Mount Sinai, rather that Israel should learn the teachings of the law as they were handed down. This is clear in many Rashis and Rambams throughout Shas.</p>
            <p>There was disagreement between the halachic authorities and the kabbalists that was very strong in the Middle Ages. This continues in every generation for the rabbis continue to disagree with the cabalists of their generation while only agreeing with the ones that have gone, like the war the rabbis made against Rabbi Chayim Lutzato and against the Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Nachman and Rabbi Abulafia. This was a continuation of the disagreements in philosophy between the ultra-orthodox Pharisees and the esoteric Essences. The root of this starts from Joseph (who was on the level of the inner truth) and his brothers. The outer truth is the halacha.</p>
            <p>The inner truth is the Kabbalah</p>
