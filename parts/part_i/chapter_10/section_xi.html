            <p>small things? The Talmudic discussions of Abbaye and Rava.” (This is the Talmudic source of the Rambam, Mishna Torah Book 1, Chapter 4). It is interesting to note that the mother of all books of musar of Torah literature, the Duties of the Heart puts science, the study of logic, and ethics on a higher spiritual plane than Torah. It is even more shocking than the Rambam, because it says this in so many words in his introduction: “I have seen fit to conclude the introduction of this book with a story that will make you zealous to understand its subjects and awaken you to know the importance of this type of commandment [of the heart] above the other type [physical] and the importance of physical science and the science of ethics and the science of logic above the wisdom of the Torah .” This study in his days was confined to Aristotle and Plato and their commentaries, and in particular Averroes.</p>

The Gra however, says, “The degree that one lacks in any one of the seven wisdoms will cause him to lack in knowledge of the Torah a hundred-fold” (referring to the division of the natural sciences into seven groups by Aristotle) (Quoted in the introduction to the translation of Euclid into Hebrew by Rabbi Baruch of Shklov the disciple of the Gra). However, the Rambam holds that science is Torah, for in the 1st two chapters of the Mishne Torah he writes basic ideas of philosophy and kabbalah, and in the next two, he writes basic concepts of science (astronomy, chemistry, etc.). Then he concludes and says, “The subjects I have written about in these first four chapters are what the Sages call “the Orchard”. Then in the laws of learning the Torah he says the things called</p>
