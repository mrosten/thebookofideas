            <p>oracle that he was the wisest, because he knew that he knew nothing. Don't look for it in the Guide because it's not there. Rabbi Nachman's war wasn't against philosophy, but the so called propagandists of France at that time known as the “philosophes”. And against subjugating revelation to reason, but he agreed that you need both, as we see in the Lekutai Moharan Vol 1 Chapt 1, Chapt 61 Vol 2, Chapt 91, and Sefer Hamidot , Daat vol. 2 num. 2 The struggle between reason and faith has had a long history in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. The regular scientists and clergy always seem to be at odds while the great geniuses of science and religion always point in the same direction to the essential fact that there is no true conflict, and that revelation and reason are both necessary and possible to achieve. This conflict and oscillation between these two poles are what spurns growth. This oscillation creates the spiritual waves that shape the existence of humankind.</p>
            <p>The thing about physics and Math is that at least they don't claim to make people better, even though they in fact have a good effect, i.e., they don't make people righteous, just a little better than what they would have been otherwise - at least it trains one to think logically - and if this would translate into action the world might just be a better place. Bertrand Russell said that there is a lot more virtue in intelligence than in virtue (the top three sephirot - Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge, vs. the lower seven - which are on the level of good and evil, permitted and forbidden, pure and impure). This is like the Rambam, in that science is on a higher spiritual level than Torah and mitzvos .</p>
            <p>Abraham Maslov said, “a soul not exposed to higher and beautiful things dries up and dies.” The Yerushalmi says, “All are prone to sickness if they lack music.” The Rambam says in the Eight Chapters that sometimes one needs to sit among the “beautiful figures” to revive his soul. Beauty is the middle</p>
