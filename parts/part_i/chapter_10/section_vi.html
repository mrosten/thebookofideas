            <h3>Section VI</h3>
            <p>pleasurable or not. All that matters is that it should be against the Torah. It's the evil angel that wrestled with Jacob that appeared to him as a Torah sage because that particular evil angel knows the law very well and put pleasure into things that would have no physical or emotional satisfaction except for the fact that this imp knows it is forbidden . The oral law is like a brick of gold that stretches from Moses until the center of the empty space [vertically]. [Prayer is going back up]. The Oral Law as contained in the Talmud is only one small horizontal slice. Since the Talmud stretches vertically this would apply also to the written law or prophecy and Kabbalah etc. Thus, we find a continuation after the Talmud of the light of the Talmud in the Geonim and later authorities.</p>
            <p>“Investigation of the wisdom of the Creator that is seen from the creations is the closest path to clarity of knowledge of His existence.” — Chovot Halevavot , Section 2, Introduction “Since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and Divine nature -- have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made” — Romans 1:20. This is the line that prompted Michal Faraday to try to understand electricity, and thus the connection between electricity and magnetism which is the source for modern electricity was discovered. “Know that proportional to one's knowledge of the Torah and the nature of the world, so the world is handed over to him and subjugated under him.” -Sefer HaMidot, Daat vol.2, Num 2.</p>
            <p>In the first four chapters of Mishnah Torah the Rambam gives a brief account of the Kabbalah of the Torah and the science that was known in his days, and finishes by saying, “The ideas of these last four chapters are what the first authorities call the ‘Pardes’” Then in Chapter 1  (Laws of Torah Study, Halachah 11-12), he writes “One must divide the time of his study, a third in the written Torah, a third in the oral Torah and a third in understanding one thing from another… which is called Gemarah… The things called the “Pardes” (the fruit tree garden) is in the category of the Gemarah.” The Rambam thus openly says that learning science is in the category of the commandment to learn Torah and also on a higher level of Torah than the Talmud and legal authorities.</p>
