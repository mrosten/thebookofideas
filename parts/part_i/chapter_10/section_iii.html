            <p>Rambam on putting ornaments on the streets of Jerusalem on the festival after the destruction of the Temple. — and the Raavad there, and the Rosh at the beginning of Masechet Avoda Zarah .) [The importance of not adding on any restrictions is to keep the patterns of chaos of each person's soul which comes from the circular sephirot and provides the energy of serving God.] Without the ideas of the science of Chaos, it is hard to understand why the Torah commands us not to add to the commandments.</p>
            <p>The laws of the written Torah are invariant. But the Jewish people are in an inertial frame of reference as compared to Mount Sinai, so all explanations which are direct traditions from Sinai always apply to them but not to non-Jews who are in an accelerating frame revolving around the empty space. Different formulations apply to them. Now even in the written Torah many laws are given that apply only in Israel like a gas that obeys the gas laws when it is in a state of equilibrium. When not in that state the only way to describe [until now] is by statistical methods. That is why since the  the laws of the Torah are statistically valid, but in cases keeping the law would invalidate its purpose to Rabbi Shimon, the law doesn't apply.

It's OK if the Torah has statistical laws because probability is part of the fabric of the spiritual and physical universe. Before the case comes to court it's a wave pattern where all the facts co-exist in mathematical wave form. But once it's in court the facts are observed and reduced to particle form. [The majority of Rabbi Nachman's advice is in fact statistical, not absolute. He simply describes the forces at work in each mitzvah but the actual effects in each person's life will be based on many factors. Like wearing tzitzis saving one from bad advice. It can cause one to get bad advice also by getting involved with religious hypocrites.</p>
            <p>However, Rabbi Nachman is referring to some degree of a spiritual effect that the tzitzis do have.] Not every</p>
