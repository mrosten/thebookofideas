            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>collect the traditions at the time of its writing and not as Divine knowledge. It is a work of genius, but it is still influenced by the time period it was created which was extremely isolationist in its point of view because of the Bar Kochba incident. The purpose in the stories is, as all the history written at that time, meant to instruct values and morals, not as historical facts. The Oral Law Torah existed as documents that the Pharisees, Scribes, and Essences had in written form [as seen in the tractates of the scribes and in the Dead Sea scrolls, which represent a body of writings from all the Jewish groups that lived then including the Jews that believed in Jesus. However, those writings have been suppressed by the Catholic Church since they contradict their ideas which are based on Paul].</p>
            <p>The Rambam held openly that the only part of the Talmud that is actually a direct tradition from Mount Sinai are the parts where the Gemarah says or assumes that something is Biblical law. The Kabbalah says the Gemarah is from Royalty of Emanation which means it came from a flow of wisdom from that sepherah like Newton received a flow of wisdom from the realm of Math and Physics -- That doesn't imply infallibility. History bears this out for we find many sources of the Braitot are actually from the Essenes who had a totally different world view from the Pharisees (the orthodox at time of the second Temple) and later from the Talmud itself. The dead sea scrolls clearly bear out the fact that the Gemarah is exactly what it claims to be, a compilation and evaluation of the millions of Braitot floating around during the Second Temple period. Evaluating the Talmud from the historical context it came in tends to take out its mythical dimensions but if done with care and respect it shows its true greatness.</p>
            <p>There is no question that you can take any statement of the Talmud or it's commentators and argue it pro and con ad infinitum. The question is as to the fruitfulness of this. The point is, no matter how far you go its only horizontal depth. The formulas of halacha result in an infinity of variations because of the slight variations of the parameters of each person's individual soul and world-line. When we don't know how to keep the commandments we are to go to the Jewish Sages (Deuteronomy 17:8-13); and that is the Talmud, which is the generality of the Oral law. However, the laws which they made to guard Biblical laws because of a specific situation which existed at that time or place, those laws don't apply in the opinion of the Rashbam and Raavad — when the reason for the law disappears so does the law. To the Rosh even, if the reason applies, if it's not in the same place where the law was originally made it doesn't apply. (See the beginning of the halachot of non-Jewish wine in the Shach and Taz.
