            <h3>Section VIII</h3>
            <p>2. The political people [people keeping and learning the laws of the Torah] from the world of Formation [on the level of good and evil]. 3. Scientists and philosophers are from Creation. 4. The highest level of those attached to God are from Emanation and included in Aristotle's contemplative category. [The religious divisions are horizontal and not vertical. Spiritual Judaism is on the inside to the left [God's right], Legal Judaism is on the inside to the right, Protestantism is just outside of Judaism on the left.</p>
            <p>Catholicism on the inside to the right. Islam is outside of both also to the right and left etc. However, all this refers to the physical Jewish people or Christian people etc. But since the Torah is given for every level and all time and all generations it refers to the higher levels also. Thus, there is a spiritual Israel with souls that are of Israel though their bodies are not, and vice versa - and this is on the level of Formation, that is , political people or people involved with the separation of good from evil in society in general.</p>
            <p>So, it is safe to assume that social minded people that are battling for the good of society, not for personal honor are from the spiritual Israel of Formation. On the next level up, those involved in contemplation of God and his works are from the spiritual Israel of Creation , p eople attached constantly to God are from the spiritual Israel of Emanation. But on all these levels everything depends on one's intent so if one is involved in contemplation of God with some ulterior motive he is not from the spiritual Israel, even though they are from Creation.</p>
