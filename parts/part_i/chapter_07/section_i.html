            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>“Not only the body, but also the soul whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, fears never remain the same… and this is equally true of knowledge… not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay… but each of them individually experiences a like change.” -Plato Symposium MANKIND PROGRESSED DOWNWARD THROUGH TIME. UNTIL JESUS WAS HIT AT THE ORIGIN. Then we came out to the other side continuing in the same direction but now progressing towards the light instead of away. “At the time of dusk there will be light.” The Zohar explained that this refers to the 272 years before the 6th millennium of the Hebrew calendar which comes out to be the year 1968.</p>
            <p>During the 6th 1000-year period there was a flow on the level of Foundation which is from 1240 until 2240. (3760 B.C. is the beginning of the 1st thousand.) This would explain the flow of wisdom since then. And the Rambam's saying in the letter to Yemen that prophesy would start then. This is leading up to the 7th thousand-year period starting 2240. This is similar to the 1 st thousand were to draw from the previous “Sabbath” on thousand years while our period is to draw from the coming thousand-year period.</p>
            <p>• Every hundred years is a blessing in a different field as a part of the process of the redemption of mankind. 1400-1500 was art. From 1500 to 1600 was the Reformation. From 1600 to 1700 was Mathematics Philosophy. From 1700 - 1800 was Music. From 1850 - 1950 was invention. 1900 - 2000 was Physics.</p>
