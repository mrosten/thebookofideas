            <p>after that is to come to the name 72 which is happiness or attachment with God which is higher than freedom. [The fact that the human being has needs of the spirit not just of the body is one reason Marx's material dialectics is mistaken. Hegel at least had the intelligence to see the motivating force of history is the quest of the Spirit for freedom [the name 63] but I believe that there is a level after that of Attachment with God [the name 72] which is a need of the soul. The Baal Shem Tov Quoted Rav Saadiyah Gaon as saying, “It is proper for a person to desire all physical things for from thence he will come to desire Torah and the service of God.” This goes along with the Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim that one who is feeling down should sit among the “Lovely forms” and listen to music. [This gave some people at the beginning of the movement of Chasidut to be somewhat promiscuous.] But this is clearly the idea of serving God by everything since there is nothing besides God and everything is God, and there is no evil in the world at all.</p>
