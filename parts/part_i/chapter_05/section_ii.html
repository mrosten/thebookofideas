            <h2>Chapter 5: Happiness</h2>
            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>where King Solomon praises happiness in one and puts it down in the other… It answers that happiness in God is a good thing, happiness not in God is not . The reason for this is that h appiness is klipat noga [the tree of knowledge of good and evil], so when it is in God it becomes included in holiness and the bad in it falls away. But depression is from the three totally evil klipot. Therefore any depression is evil. Now you could ask about Mozart and Beethoven or artists in general where it seems a bit of unhappiness stirred and inspired their best creations. On one level you can answer that their experiences were unhappy, not their attitude. Also , Rabbi Shneur Zalman explained that judgements come from a higher source than blessings so when one stays attached to God in the long run the judgements turn into the highest blessings.</p>
            <p>“Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals without a curse.” -Sophocles. Heisenberg was embarrassed at his oral exam for his P.H.D. when he didn't know how to work out the resolution of a microscope, and he had to go and re-learn it. When the next year he developed Matrix Mechanics [or quantum mechanics] the subject of resolution became a powerful tool to show the truth of the uncertainty principle. There was a young woman accused of communists ties and her reputation ruined and almost lost her job. She went to the president of the company to ask him to stick up for her. He took an interest in her and besides helping her keep her job he married her. She became the first lady of the USA, the wife of President George Bush.</p>
            <p>Aristotle had a basic philosophy of happiness that I would like to write down in summary form in order to show the logical basis for why it is important to keep the mitzvot . Socrates</p>
