            <h2>Chapter 5: Happiness</h2>
            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>said, “An unexamined life is not worth living.” Aristotle said, “An unplanned life is not worth examining”. He held that one has to have a plan. But not any plan will do. He held that there is only one right plan. If one lives by the wrong plan, he will not have a good life. Now there are things we do just to live. But there are other things we do in order to live well, i.e., achieve happiness and enrich our lives. But we live in order to live well, i.e., to have happiness. Who could say that they don't want happiness? Happiness is the highest goal. People are happy because they have what they want. Yet we all have different wants. But in truth though we want different things, living well is really the same for us all.</p>
            <p>There are things that we want and things that we need. The need for food and the need for knowledge are human needs. Some things we want aren't good for us but things we need are always good for us. The need for food we feel but there are other needs that we don't feel so readily. The one right plan for living is to seek and acquire the things that are really good for us, the things we need to live and the things we need to live well. Thus, happiness is really the same for everybody. It is to acquire the things that are really good for us to have.</p>
            <p>These are external needs of the body and internal needs of the mind. The mind by reason of its nature needs to know. Thus there are the goods of the mind such as knowledge and skills and especially the skill of thinking. There is also the need of the heart to love and be loved. Also there is the need for self-esteem and honor if it is honor for the right reasons. [I believe there is also a human need for freedom.] There is also another kind of need, the need of the soul for good habits or virtues, i.e., the habit of choosing the virtuous thing without having to go through a difficult process every time a situation comes up: as in temperance and courage.</p>
            <p>The reason God gave us the Torah is to teach us the virtues of the mind [right</p>
