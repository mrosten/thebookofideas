            <h2>Chapter 5: Happiness</h2>
            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>Incidentally the Lekutai Moharan of Rabbi Nachman is also filled with these loops as Rabbi Nathan pointed out, like sexual purity and prayer depending one on the other, etc. There is a way to get the infinite spirals of logic to converge by means of the idea of the improper integral that converges, i.e., if we could find the formula for any one of these spirals we could see if they can converge to a definite sum by integrating them. Now this is related to politics in the following way: Living in a good society is necessary for happiness because the plan and organization of a society can be helpful to attain this happiness (or a hindrance, as I have mentioned). Not all forms of government are good for this goal. The type of government necessary for happiness is a democracy, since the government that is good helps the people achieve happiness.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Torah gives the people the prerogative to appoint a King. A government that serves the bureaucracy is not a good government. Since people are created with equality, all should have an equal chance to advance themselves - not just those that are part of the government. A government is not good that treats equals as unequal's and gives unfair advantage to one person over another by free hand outs to one group or another. The real goods that we need, like virtue and courage, are largely dependent on our individual decisions. The government should not tax one group to give to another, for that is not treating people equally. Only in the case of deprivation, that some people suffer because of some misfortune not in their power to control, should the government help. The State can only supply the conditions of peace necessary for happiness, but it can't make people happy, or even be sure that the people will make the right decisions. To expect the government to do more is to invite tyranny. However, there must be a body of judges to counterbalance the effect of the democracy since in any free society there is a class of unskilled labor that are going to feel disenfranchised financially and in other ways by the establishment and who feel they have nothing to lose by disrupting the system, so they become anti­-morality since they feel morality is simply to serve the rich. They feel they have a right to other people's money. This class can become powerful enough to destroy the society and thus the Torah supports a balanced system.</p>
            <p>This disagrees with Hegel in that the study of history isn't just a way of coming to the right government or coming to freedom. However, Hegel’s idea is rooted in Kabbalah and especially that of Rabbi Shneur Zalman that the combining of Tohu and Tikun leads to them coming up to and being included in the Name 63 which is the root of Freedom. Thus, the plan of the Torah is to create a space for each individual where they can grow and keep the mitzvot and not be infringed upon by society at large, and yet still be a part of the whole. I think the level</p>
