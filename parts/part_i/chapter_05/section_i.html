            <h2>Chapter 5: Happiness</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>“Life without pleasure is impossible.” – Thomas Aquinas Happiness is the result of motion upward or inward, which depends on one's upward or inward energy. Some people have only upward energy, and some have energy that drives them inward. But there is a law of conservation of energy which results in the law of conservation of happiness. Only a certain amount of happiness is granted to one. But by association with others, one reaches a state of equilibrium with them. If they are unhappy then eventually one’s happiness gets dissipated by them. But by prayer, learning Torah and Wisdom, and kindness you can draw more from God (but you can't create it yourself). Each of these (or any service connected with the ten Divine sephirot), draws with it, when done in connection with God, a certain light and happiness related to its own sepherah and also brings with it a special physical blessing, e.g., kindness brings love into one's life, sexual purity brings sex (i.e. not to have sex in a wrong way tends to bring sex in the right way). A result of this law is that great pleasure and great pain always come together so that the equilibrium will be preserved. An example of this is the Kennedy family.</p>
            <p>There is another conservation law of spiritual energy, that if you spend it on one thing you won't have it for something else; so, choose wisely. Try to spend it on things that will draw further energy from the Source, i.e., good deeds. [Using one's spiritual energy is what Rabbi Nachman means by praying with strength. Yet, because of the law of conservation of spiritual energy, one should be careful how he uses it and conserve it for important things and not use it all up on small things]. Rabbi Nachman says that it is always an important commandment to be happy [in God].</p>
            <p>So, if you have a doubt about if you should do something or not, i.e., if it's God's will or not, then look at the happiness factor. If it's there, then it's God's will. [I think that the translation from Rabbi Nachman's Yiddish into the Hebrew aphorism that “It is a great mitzvah to be happy always”, is a mistranslation for there is no such mitzvah. Rather he meant, “It is always a great mitzvah to be happy”- i.e., to be happy and rejoice in the Lord. The Gemarah in Avoda Zara asks on the contradiction between the verses in Kohelet,</p>
