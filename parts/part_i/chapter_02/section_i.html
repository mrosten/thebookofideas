            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Faith is a force that encompasses various forms. In scientists, it takes a hold of them, causing them to seem to understand the world; and for mystics -- the understanding of God. Devout people are guided by a different Divine trait than non-devout. So, for example, non-devout people, by trusting in God might not get their needs fulfilled unless they actually do something physical for it; whereas for devout people, they might have all their needs fulfilled through only faith. It might actually be the opposite of the Divine will for them to do something about it! According to the Jewish viewpoint, most spiritual systems represent a valid frame of reference in the local sense, as long as they fulfill certain criteria. For Jews then, it must not deny the commandments of the Bible, and for non-Jews, the validity of the 7 - Noahide l aws must be maintained.</p>
            <p>This idea is reflected in a certain book of a Jewish mystic who lived during the Middle Ages. He stated that it is forbidden for a Jew or Christian to convert to the other's faith since “he just mixes up the flow.” One may learn from the other’s but not convert. <sup>[4]</sup> I believe, however, that all faiths hold mistakes that should be ultimately corrected. Today, it is actually possible to test the validity of many statements of the Sages, for they make empirically verifiable claims, i.e., certain actions causally precedes certain results. With today’s methods of statistical analysis, it would be a simple matter to conduct research on such issues.</p>
