            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>religions as occupying the 7 lower sephirot , on the y ⎯ axis. But once you get up above religion into the 3 higher sephirot, the air has cleared, so to speak, and we are closer to the light coming in from the upper–vertical direction. Since good and evil are represented by the x–axis, even though we may be lying above religion, we are neither good nor evil. The battle is not between good and evil but rather between truth and mistake. Perhaps this explains the opinion of the Rambam that ‘the suffering of Job came because he did not learn science and philosophy.’ Although he was righteous, he didn't seek knowledge. Religion is on the level of the 7 lower sephirot which when one gets involved in automatically causes him suffering. Usually he seeks for answers in the religion, i.e., via a rabbi or a clergyman within the religion, but from a higher perspective all knowledge is one.</p>
            <p>Since every person's soul is different, the laws of religion can never fit perfectly with him. Accordingly, by nature, the results of one following the laws of any religion, if applied with rigor, will then follow patterns of chaos – according to each individual. If however the laws are applied in a more loose fitting way, the affects on the person, following patterns of probability, will average out—like the binomial distribution . <sup>[7]</sup> There is a basic distinction between the humanistic view and the religious: namely, the humanistic view places great value on the concept of freedom whereas the religious view does not consider it at all. The reason for this may be reflected in that the source of the religious point of view is the world–of–correction , tikun–brudim, and the source of the humanistic point of view is the world of world–points , nekudim . The ultimate correct way is to have them included in the other.</p>
