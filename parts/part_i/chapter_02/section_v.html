            <h2>Chapter 2: The Song Of Faith</h2>
            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>involves reading every page forwards and backwards. To learn in this way takes tremendous faith and one sees the results only after many years. One can never really change one ’ s religion . Religion is the accumulation of stories, songs and religious general consciousness that one gains as a child. If one “changes ” his religion all he is doing in fact is silencing himself — and say the person goes into politics he might bring into the new group ideas left over from his religious mindset — ideas that don’t belong there — ideas such as the necessity of his way of life upon all (or death).</p>
            <p>The Catholics were very clever when they decided to incorporate various elements in the religions that they conquered instead of banishing them. The Rabbi’s today also, should not dismiss anything of the culture of those that come to them, unless he is keenly aware of what is involved (and what are the negative, and acceptable elements in it). The Rambam explains why the Torah required sacrifices. And also regarding how some of the philosophical tradition came to be incorporated in Judaism by the Sages and the Rambam was also through this means. And today, the tendency of the rabbis to take out of the Torah (through ignorance) the things that generations ago were acceptable, only leads to the destruction of Torah life.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to me the grand departure from the ancient Torah way of life by the Jews was the result of the rabbis not in being able to evaluate what really was acceptable in tradition, and what (of what was new) was compatible.</p>
