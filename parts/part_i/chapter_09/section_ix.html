            <h3>Section IX</h3>
            <p>doesn't make one spiritual. All the above mentioned spiritual levels are only on the level of the spirit not the soul. Developing of one's spiritual self is by prayer and meditation. One needs learning to provide the vessels to contain the light of prayer and meditation, and one needs good deeds to contain the light of learning. However, the drawing of the light is specifically by silent thought. Action draws the nefesh ; words of Torah draw the spirit, and quiet thought draws the soul. This is something the Ari alluded to when he said that unifications are higher than Torah [Saint Frances of Assisi also mentioned this fact].</p>
            <p>Rabbi Nachman's way of learning is just to read the words out loud, and to do a little bit every day of each book one needs to learn — and if you do it in order and over the course of many years you will have completed at least once all of the books of Science, Math, Kabbalah, Halacha, etc. And in the end, you will understand much better than if you had labored over every point. But you can only succeed in this if you have faith in Rabbi Nachman, since only by faith will you have the stubbornness to continue this for many years before seeing results.] There is a hint in the Torah that just by wanting to learn and understand one does merit to it. For the work of the Tabernacle could be done only by the wise in heart as it says several places in Exodus. And in Exodus 36:2 it says, “every person wise in heart whom the Lord put wisdom in his heart, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come close to the work to do it.” Thus, we see that God put wisdom into the hearts of those who wanted to do the work.</p>
