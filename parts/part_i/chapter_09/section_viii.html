            <h3>Section VIII</h3>
            <p>doesn't apply to him. For instance; theoretically, I think it is clear from the Zohar that Tikun Chatzot is more important than v esikin . However, I believe for many people the need for Vesikin outweighs that of Chatzot because of their particular type of soul. This may apply also to living in Israel where clearly it it a great thing to all opinions even to the Rambam; however, there are hidden things that cause it not to be a mitzva . In fact, nothing in the Torah can you really know is a mitzva until you really know what is going on in the hidden things. Just judging based on knowledge of the halacha is worse than not knowing at all — for when one knows nothing then he may follow his heart. If you ask then, why was the Torah given. The answer is to teach us to go into our hearts to find God and give us the basic principles that are really in our hearts and minds but from which we have become estranged.</p>
            <p>This is the Rambam's opinion that all the commandments are really based on reason and their force comes from the fact that they are already in our heart, not because they are written. This applies to learning. For, in theory one should learn slowly and review and not go further until he gets what he is learning now. But in fact, in practice, it is better not to do it in that way. The reason is that is the climbing way from the lower sepherah to the higher one step by step. But since faith is connected to the crown, if one simply has faith and learns simply, he comes to the highest knowledge, the knowledge that is higher than knowledge the crown. This is signified by the way books are set up. For as one reads from the top of the page to the bottom, he is going through the sephirot that are containing in the inner logic of the book. Then as he returns, he has effectively gone from crown to faith and back and this is absorbed into his soul. [I think one should each day learn only the amount he has set for himself to learn day by day, no more and no less].</p>
