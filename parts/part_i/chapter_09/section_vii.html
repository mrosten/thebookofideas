            <h2>Chapter 9: On Learning Torah</h2>
            <h3>Section VII</h3>
            <p>says in the beginning of Shaar Ruach HaKodesh . Here again [as I noted in the chapter I deas in Science ], we have the diagonal such that we only have the trace the things from the top left to the bottom right. Every level of Torah has a different inner light and meaning. Kabbalah is only the inner meaning of Torah horizontally, not vertically. This is obvious from books like the Nefesh HaChayim which says that the innerness of the words of prayer is in the letters themselves not in the kabalistic intentions. Also, the fact that the Torah says only a third verse can explain contradictions and not any outside explanation means that the Torah is postulating an inner meaning to itself in itself, not in the Oral law (since no outside explanations are permitted). Soloke in number theory if it is consistent, it must be incomplete.</p>
            <p>So, inside the Torah there must be a super-Torah. So, I postulate that the system of Torah in the above diagram from the Rashash continues downwards [and upwards.] “To come to the truth of science and Kabbalah is possible by prayer. One should especially concentrate in the blessing Ahavah Raba before the Shema and in the blessing ‘give knowledge’, in Shemone Esre.” - from Reb Shemelke of Nickolsburg. My theory of learning is thus: When one gets up in the morning he is in a relaxed state of mind. In my opinion this state is the only time any real learning can be done. Talking with anyone or even saying ‘hello’ causes a break in the neuron connection that causes any learning done after that to not be absorbed — for we see that some things we learn and forget after some time. Yet other things stick inside one permanently. Therefore, all real learning has to be done in the morning.</p>
            <p>[The Baal Shem Tov hinted to this, for he had a tradition from Achia HaShiloni that the day one has anger in the morning he won't be able to learn anything after that.] There are many things in the yidishkeit [the practice of the Torah that theoretically prescribe one way but in practice is otherwise. Sometimes, the reason is that a person was created in a certain way such that the theory</p>
