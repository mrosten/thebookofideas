            <h3>Section X</h3>
            <p>It seems from this that as God puts more energy into the empty space the radius gets bigger. The singularity of infinite light in the center of the empty space is what causes it to be curved. The outer light surrounding the straight sephirot is the magnetic field from the name 52 surrounding a current-bearing conductor of the light of the name 45. The circular sephirot are rotating in an external magnetic field and that is how they create the electric current of the straight sephirot, as the sages said, “there is a sphere that circles around in the world”.</p>
            <p>(The Circular sephirot are 3­D spheres rotating sideways into the 4 th spiritual dimension). (Since they are accelerating, they give out gravitational waves also, which also affects the straight sephirot. Obviously, the broken vessels give out gravitational waves also as they fall and later rise). (The straight sephirot have to be electric since they are straight and don't make a complete circle like a magnetic field). This leaves us with figuring out how the next 3 forces relate to the names 63 and 72 and this certainly seems to imply that the straight lines of gravity are produced by some rotating outer field of some higher force surrounding the 3 dimensions of the universe.</p>
            <p>The universe operates like a pentode <sup>[11]</sup> , and this explains the reason for the grid between Emanation and Creation (the suppressor grid) and between Creation and Formation (the screen grid) and between Formation and the physical universe (the control grid) -- the main idea is because the current is AC (i.e., reaching and not reaching as it explains at length in the Eitz Chayim). You use a grid to make a change in the plate current (the source of the light) by small changes in the grid potential that is caused by mitzvot and good deeds. [There is one problem with this and that is that the current shouldn't be affected by distance, so how can I explain the fact that the Eitz Chayim says distance and resistance are factors.] The wavelength of the light of each sephirah is</p>

            <p>When the string of the vessel of the Crown is plucked, it emits a wave with harmonics. The frequency of the crown is 10 times the frequency of Royalty. The problem was that all the harmonics were above that of the Crown, so the lower vessels broke. The correction was when the string of Royalty was plucked and the higher sephirot were its harmonics, so the energy was less.</p>
