            <h3>Section VI</h3>
            <p>The ten circular sephirot are actually energy waves emanating from the vibration of the roof of the empty space. The dot in the middle also vibrates and gives off its own circular sephirot. So actually Faith, Sexual purity etc., are actually energy waves. Every individual gives them off by the degree he holds on to every trait. The area under the singularity of the infinite light is negative time, to the right is positive space, to the left negative space from where the worlds of negative probabilities emerge. Imaginary space is the opposite side.</p>
            <p>The center of the empty space which is the singularity of the infinite light gives off waves like a drop falling on a lake which are its circular sephirot as opposed to the circular sephirot which enter the empty space from above. What makes the world line of the circular sephirot [the Igulim] tilt away from the vertical is the speed they rotate through the empty space. Since they rotate at speeds faster than light, they have horizontal world lines. The circular form of those sephirot is due to the fact they are traveling in a time field which causes them to bend, just like an electron traveling at an angle to a magnetic field. (The straight sephirot are time-like [They travel slower than the speed of the light, so the Eitz Chayim refers to them as if they were stationary which only means that they are an inertial frame of reference) and the circular sephirot are space-like.) Since the empty space is finite without boundaries, and in the opinion of the Ramchal it refers to time and space one can travel indefinitely in one direction in time as we are in fact doing and find ourselves at the beginning of time at the top of the empty space.</p>
            <p>·<???> The level of reaching and not reaching is given by: [IMAGE: image011.gif] [the regular wave equation] The reason I am saying that it is a derivative is that the Eitz Chayim says at the very beginning of his book that the division of the sephirot continues indefinitely. (However, the Rashash seems to have a different opinion.)</p>
