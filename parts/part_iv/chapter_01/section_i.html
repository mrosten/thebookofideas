            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Ideas in Kabbalah - The Song of the Soul Introduction Science and Kabbalah are two distinct fields with apparently no relationship between them. However here is my intention to show how each can illuminate the other as long as each keeps to its respective parameters. Mathematics is the lowest sepherah of the spiritual world and the highest of the physical, as Rabbi Luria says “the essence of numbers is in the sepherah of Royalty”, so its’ laws govern both disciplines. Rabbi Issac Luria uses a physical model to describe the spiritual reality (as per the Eitz Chayim).</p>
            <p>In this as physics needs mathematical models to clarify itself, so the spiritual world needs physical models to make clear its meaning. These I also will attempt to show but bear in mind these are different worlds-- parallel but different, and each lower world provides a model for what is above it and is like a reflection in a pond. I think that every mathematical model has a corresponding spiritual and a corresponding physical reality. Now know , many will object that the formalist philosophy of mathematics claims that math only deals with abstract symbols that may or may not have a relation to reality. But this simply isn't true. Reality itself seems to be based on math, and mathematicians know this. They use the theory of numbers as an aid to gain knowledge about formal systems, and thus they show that in truth they believe that numbers are actually a part of reality.</p>
            <p>Four types of flux (or Divine light) flow into the spiritual empty space: The Divine names 72, 63, 45, 52 , i.e., gravitational, strong, weak, and electro-magnetic. The four worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation and Action correspond to the four types of space: metric space, normed space, Banach space, and Hilbert space - where for each different types of operations are valid. [The Ari is clear that in AK even ideas of spiritual space don't apply so he is apparently talking about a spiritual space where the concept of distance</p>
