            <p>understanding by w. Thus, the stress tensor is: T = itk + jtb + ktv + ltw + mtc. (This involves more than ten components). The Empty space should be limited to some dimensions, not infinite dimensional, and the straight light coming down should be one dimension less. The reason I think it has to be finite dimensional is so that a description of it will be necessary and sufficient. Only to God is the near the same as the far but as we describe distances and time even in a spiritual way the description has to be confined to some limited number of dimensions to have any meaning.</p>
            <p>The empty space rotates on its axis and revolves around a center point and one outside itself and this produces the flux's that enters it. The rotation causes it to be in the form of an ellipsoid i.e. X 2 / a 2 + y 2 / b 2 + z 2 / c 2 = 1. The empty space has the quality of hiding the light of God, and every level of hiding hides the previous level so one doesn't know that God is hidden and thinks he is close to God. And that level is hidden by another level in a continuous progression. Each level is a different level of darkness. The character of God's Infinite Light is that as it progresses further down through the darkness it illuminates one more level of hiding. Every higher level of light that comes into the world defuses a greater degree of darkness.</p>
            <p>Since the empty space is rotating it must have an ergosphere. The singularity in the center of the empty space is connected to the light surrounding the space through an outside dimension.</p>
