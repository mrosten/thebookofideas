            <p>dissolves — Isn't that Tensor space?] In general, the Kabbalah seems to deal only with totally arithmetic operations [gematriot], except it hints to the other types of space only occasionally, e.g., when the Ramak brings down that: é 2 + + ä 2 å 2 + ä 2 = 186 = place [makom] which indicates that this is a 4-d place, and that a norm comes out to be the square root of 186... The 5 forms (partzufim) have their origin in the 5 flows from the name 72, 63, 45, 52, which are Gravitational, Strong, Weak, Magnetism-Electricity.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the circular sephirot and the straight ones is that the 10-component curvature tensor of the circular sephirot is proportional to the 10-component energy-stress tensor of the straight ones. (The Eitz Chayim seems clear that the basic existence of vessels, or what we call ‘matter’ is in the straight sephirot, and matter is best represented by the energy-stress tensor). The constant of proportionality should be decided in a way that the normal 613 commandments for Jews and 7 commandments for the children of Noah should be reproduced under normal circumstances of weak fields and small velocities [i.e., that these basic laws of human conduct are invariable in all frames of reference and it is possible to understand their application in all situations if we can know the constants and exact formula, for, as of now I understand that the laws of the Torah are eternal and unchanging yet their application is unknown in many circumstances.] The 10 components of the energy-stress tensor in the spiritual realm which describe the distribution and flux of energy and linear momentum of every sepherah or soul. This tensor follows the four laws of continuity which</p>
