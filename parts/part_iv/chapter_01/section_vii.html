            <p>Y is the distance from the light to the top of the empty space. [IMAGE: image012.gif] is the distance to the side of the wave of the Infinite Light as it vibrates. [IMAGE: image013.gif] is the velocity of the wave which is [IMAGE: image014.gif] for light: c=(?)(T/r). ( T is the tension of the empty space (?) is the density.) If f is a regular mapping of a good deed on a surface of the soul or onto the surface of the empty space, then for every point there is a coordinate patch [IMAGE: image015.gif] on the soul such that [IMAGE: image015.gif] a coordinate patch on S.</p>
            <p>Resistance in the higher sephirot of emanation is a characteristic of the vessels of the sephirot without which they couldn't shine out their own light (they would still allow the infinite light of God to radiate from within them, but with resistance they form a R-L-C circuit, and they emanate their own unique frequency of light). The frequency of the light coming into the empty space is infinite, and only lessened by its coming into the circular sephirot. <???> Each sephirah is a sphere only in its own dimension it's a hollow cylinder with respect to the higher one, like a circle is only closed in flat-land but with respect to the three dimensional world it is hollow. Thus, the sephirot are closed with regard to observer in spiritual 4-d space but a long cylinder from the aspect of 5-d space. The probability density of the vessel of each sephirah varies inversely as the square of the distance from the center since density of (x, y, z) = k / r 2 so M= òòò (x,y,z)dV = 4kr unit</p>
