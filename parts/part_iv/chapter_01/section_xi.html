            <p>The uncertainties of the world of akudim (the wave pattern of the sepherot , literally “streaked”) come in mathematical wave form in probability space. The distance between the sephirah of the crown and wisdom is (2-1) (r) if r is the radius of the empty space. (As you continue down you keep the same order). (As the empty space expands and contracts the radius varies, so at one period in time one might be able to rise from one level to the next easily since there is just a small distance to go and at other periods in history or in one's own life it might be very difficult). (As we progress toward the singularity in the center, humanity goes from one level to the next very quickly. I know many people have wondered why it took humanity such a long time to make any slight bit of progress in the olden days while now it seems every 10 years, we enter into a new century. (And every century is 1000 years of the old time). However, the expanding of the empty space caused a spiritual red shift of the light as it came down to us. One of the reasons that the light that we receive in the physical universe is much denser and more physical than the spiritual light in the higher worlds is that the light has gone through the whole empty space to reach us, and that empty space is expanding so there is a red shift in the frequency of the light. So, this explains why to the Ari there is a change is the essential nature of the light as it travels a distance in the higher worlds.</p>
            <p>The top of the spiritual empty space is the top of the future light cone. The world inside it is made of time-like directions. We are going down in it because from the aspect of Einstein's equations (time is a negative coordinate) the right side is positive space the left is negative space - where the particles of negative probabilities emerge from. The bottom side of the singularity of the infinite light is negative time:</p>

            <p>The orientation of the sephirot is either right handed, left handed or zero spin. Their position in regard to each other is as is stated in the Eitz Chayim, however they also have spin. The Right hand Sephirot have right-hand spin, the middle none, and the left have left-hand spin. Splendor and Eternity have half integer spin and are thus subject to Fermi Statistics. Kindness and Power have whole integer spin and are thus subject to Einstein-Bose Statistics. One result of this is that any flow coming from the right-handed sephirot like kindness or</p>
