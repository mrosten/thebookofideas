The ability of the righteous like Bava Sali to see beyond the confines of space is because they are spiritually raised to spiritual 5 space where they can see space and time laid out before them as a map. ·<???> The surrounding lights of the sephirot (Chayah and Yechidah) are fields, not lights per say. The light from understanding (Binah) is related to the electromagnetic force, in that the hashmal outer covering of Zeir and Nukbah come from it. Binah is composed of higher and lower levels, as the Ari goes into at great length.</p>
            <p>B= 0 (H+M) (B is the entire induction field of Binah, Binah Ilaah (The higher Understanding) is the magnetic field H, Tvunah is the density M). For the Chashmal (electricity) to emanate from Binah, Binah has to be rotating in relation to Zeir and Nukbah (the two sephirot of Beauty and Royalty) The simple explanation of the light that is left in the vessels as the main light goes back up is that it is like light that shines on the surface of something and the surface heats up because of the energy that got absorbed. The question is what in the world is the second light that Rabbi Luria says is left there?! (I would suggest that it refers to the photo-electric effect.) The 22 Hebrew letters have numerical value, but they also represent functions.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the 10 letters which represent the 10 sephirot, t”vdyps t”rpB d” g b s”ma are representative of 10 functions, depending on what world you are in: In Emanation of math they are the Gamma function, the Beta function, the Bessel function, Fourier Integral, Legendre function, the error function, the complementary error function, the sine integral, the cosine integral, Fresnel function, Fresnel cosine function. The normal distribution coming from sephiros deYosher is the reason the light of nekudim</p>
