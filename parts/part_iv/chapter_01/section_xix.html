            <p>the left is emanation. There are ten empty spaces, and each is divisible into ten, which are divisible into ten ad infinitum. Each one is on a different plane, i.e., the three dimensional sphere is surrounded by a 4-D sphere which is surrounded etc. Each has its own surrounding sephirot in its own dimension. For instance, our empty space is surrounded by Royalty of the Infinite One which is surrounded etc. Like this: [IMAGE: image032.gif] A = The empty space. b = Top of the empty space, circular Royalty of the Infinite One.</p>
            <p>c = Square royalty of the Infinite One. This is what the Kabbalists of the Middle Ages call the Royalty of the Infinite One. However, I haven't seen the Ari mention it. d = Circular foundation. e = Square foundation. The square sephirot are the source of the linear sephirot in the empty space. The lines coming down from the top to the center are the roots of the sephirot in the shape of an Eagle. The lines of the left side are the root of the sephirot in the shape of a lion. The right is the root of the Bull. The lines coming up to the center are the sephirot of Adam Kadmon, the sephirot in the shape of a person, which is the general subject of the Eitz Chayim. The time-axis is negative, so to get the regular order we are used to you have to turn it upside down. This, it seems, is the root of the Baal Hatanya's idea of equating tohu [chaos] with the angles of the Divine Chariot.</p>
            <p>The idea of turning the whole thing over is Rabbi Nachman's of man ruling over the angels. [I know there are many times when it seems the Baal Hatanya has no source in the Kabbalah but with patience, I have usually found some source for him. For instance, it bothered me a long time that he equated the higher Unification with the higher knowledge. Now that has no way of working with the Drush HaDaat at the end of the Eitz Chayim. Eventually, I discovered that the commentary on the Rashash, the Shemen Sasson, says Drush HaDaat is only the generality of the Emanation and in fact doesn't work with the specifics, and that the higher Israel and Understanding are half of The Father and the Mother</p>
