            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>are from the four letters of the Ineffable Name. The ten components of the Einstein tensor (the rearrangement of the Ricci tensor) which deals with the curvature of spiritual and physical space-time is the source of the gravitational field. The energy stress tensor describes the 10 straight sephirot and the Einstein vector is the 10 circular sephirot - Einstein figured out that they must be proportional - I'm just saying the same thing for the sephirot like he said for the vectors. What this means is that the spiritual powers of the commandments and the ten statements as they condense into the physical realm become the energy stress tensor and the Einstein vector tensor. [That is, the commandments are a measure of the spiritual mass-energy (vessels and light) energy density and momentum of a person], this involves an approach to the sephirot different than the regular one, for here we are saying that the first 9 describe the components of the 3-d tensor which traditionally would be just 6 sephirot.</p>
            <p>Thus, there are twenty amino acids which correspond to the twenty symbols of TNT which correspond to the twenty components of the curvature of four dimensional space, which correspond to the twenty components of the Einstein tensor and the mass energy tensor that have to be proportional according to Einstein. [See page 533 of Gödel, Escher, Bach]. Also, there are ten equations that describe a fluid in four and ten quantities that characterize that fluid corresponding to the ten sephirot of yosher and the ten of igulim...The correlations thus; 1) I am the Lord p = p (n, s) 2) Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, T = (n, s) 3) Remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy, d r=[r+ p]/n+nTds the first law of thermodynamics [conservation of energy] 4) Honor thy father and thy mother, m =(r+ p)/n 5) Thou shalt not kill, dn/d t=Ñ u n</p>
