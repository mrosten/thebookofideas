            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>factor of k again — since your inspiration was increased by by that amount. So you get (inspiration) (k 2 ) If you do that n times, your inspiration will be (inspiration) ( k 2 ). Now back to the beginning. At the time you did the second repentance you also do a repentance on your first repentance since your realize that it wasn't complete. The first time you repent on your first repentance you get some inspiration. The second time you get (inspiration)(k). The next time you get (inspiration) (k 2 ). Now, at the time you do your third repentance on the sin, and the second repentance on the first repentance, you do your first repentance on the second repentance.</p>
            <p>So at the time you have done this process n times you have Inspiration(kn) + inspiration (kn-1) +…+ inspiration. If you take the limit as you do this an infinite number of times you get the  Integral(inspiration) (kn)] dn = (Inspiration) (kn)/(ln k) where the ln k signifies the lower dot of the aleph [the Divine name 52] and the dividing sign is the line dividing the aleph and kn is the top dot of the aleph [the Divine name 161]. The way of learning of Rabbi Nachman includes two different points. One that just by saying the words the understanding comes into the mind. The other is to learn in order without skipping around. My idea of saying the words backwards comes from the Ari and the aal Shem Tov who have different unifications based on that idea, and the Ramchal explains in his New Zohar that the saying of the words backwards brings the light back to the source -- so it's like sewing -- where it is helpful to go backwards also. The practical way of implementing this is to have a place marker in the several books that one needs to learn and have a certain fixed amount that one does of each one each day.</p>
