            <h2>Chapter 3: Rav Nachman</h2>
            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Breslov Rabbi Nachman is the only tzadik that allows himself to be tested experimentally by making solid statistical predictions easy to test experimentally. E.g. “Shabbat and the Torah give physical life (not just spiritual).” Although you can say that the Christians have Jesus which balances that out, but then you could test it with religious and non-religious Jews. Honesty shouldn't make a difference for their degree of honesty isn't that different. Now there are lots of differences by each individual like smoking but or going to Uman for Rosh Hashanah, but all the variables should average out to give people who keep Shabbat and learn Torah a longer life.</p>
            <p>·2 Rabbi Nachman's ideas in the Lekutei Moharan are general principles applying to people, and to show the inter-relationship between the ideas, but not as advice. This is because any general principal changes dramatically when applied to the individual and only the individual himself can know how it applies to him. This is the idea of uniting Correction and Chaos together, for when you draw the higher light of Chaos into the vessels of Correction you get a different result than drawing the light of Correction into the vessels of Chaos.</p>
            <p>(Power) x (t)/(m)x(a)=x; i.e., the distance the sephirot are lifted during the year. This is why it's important to go to Uman on Rosh Hashanah, for the vertical column of light of power is there. Rabbi Nachman hints at the basic principle of Quantum Mechanics, that seeing makes the vessel (i.e. that observing the photon wave makes it take particle form. (It's interesting to note that in the Eitz Chayim of Rabbi Issac Luria, mass (the vessel) is considered dense energy, so apparently he knew intuitively the mass energy equivalence).</p>
            <p>In the Lekutai Moharan we find many things which lead to the divine spirit or salvation etc. These are independent variables that effect the final result. So lets say children are dependent on the land of Israel, the succah, prayer etc. Then, children = A(land of Israel) + B(succah) + C(prayer) + …… + D; where A, B, C and D are constants. So, if succah and prayer would remain the same, and the land of Israel would go up by one unit, then children would go up by an amount of A. We assume here that the effects of the land of Israel and Succah and prayer are additive, i.e., that the amount that Succah effects them doesn't</p>
