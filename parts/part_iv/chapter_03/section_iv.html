            <h2>Chapter 3: Rav Nachman</h2>
            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>In that same lesson in the Lekutai Moharan , vol 1. chapt. 6, we see that the amount that the honor of God is increased depends on how much the person has changed from a state of sin to the state of good and the change one has of greater honor to lesser, i.e. the honor of God isn't dependent on one's being good but rather on change from a lower to a higher state, and similarly there is a need for an active lessening of ones own honor. Therefore the proper relationship is : Honor of God = D State of goodness is that goodness or goodness] / D Self-honor .</p>
            <p>Since these are two independent variables as we take the limit as DC® 0 , D y® 0 we we have:<???> <Clear up the last paragraph please?> † [IMAGE: image051.gif] The general solution of this linear partial differential equation will contain two arbitrary functions. I think they are the finding of one's proper partner as mentioned in Lekutai Moharan [vol 2] and becoming included in the Higher Man who sits on the Throne which is the result of doing the higher and lower repentance of chap. 6. This would explain why these two things result from the higher and lower repentance mentioned in this chapter [i.e., chapter 6 of the Lekutai Moharan] If one has masturbated he should say the 10 psalms, 16, 32, 41, 42, 57, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150 and immerse himself in a natural body of water all on that same day as Rabbi Nachman said.</p>
