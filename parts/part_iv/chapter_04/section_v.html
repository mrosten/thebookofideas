            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>reason why people’s lives are a series of ups and downs -- and the ups and downs get more frequent as time goes by but less dramatically, since the radius of curvature increases proportionally to how far you are from the origin [your birth]. This also explains why in the explanation of the higher repentance, Rabbi Nachman describes an integral, since in fact the x-coordinate of a person progressing towards that point is x=a  n cosTd This also explains the reason, for the  /2 is the equation for uncertainty, which is the root of this universe, for this comes from the asymptotes of the formula for the Clothoid [a(  /2) 1/2 , a(  /2) 1/2 ) In the Christian world there has been a great debate between the two poles -- of individual spirituality versus that of the group, according to the level one holds in the hierarchy and the need to receive ones holiness from the rabbi or the priest etc.</p>
            <p>Now Rabbi Nachman combines both poles. For, to him, the importance of belief in wise men is of utmost importance. Yet, he also stresses individual spirituality, and says that each person has in him a level of the Messiah. But he combines these ideas, for he says that one really has three centers of mass that he must revolve around: that of himself, of his friend and of his teacher.</p>
