            <p>of existence], and further even in good or evil there is right and left. That is, the evil of evil or the good of evil, i.e. that even an evil person won't go to that degree of evil. Concerning the way of learning recommended by Rabbi Nachman — of just saying the words in order, and having faith that one will eventually understand — it is interesting to see the Maharsha on Avoda Zara 19a, who says that the two ways of learning of just saying the words, or being exact, and repeating the ideas over and over until one gets it is a argument in the Gemara over there.</p>
            <p>Then, the Gemara says that the rabbis knew the statements about learning carefully but didn't listen to it because they followed the advice of just saying the words. To the Maharsha, Rav Nachman bar Issac learned in the quick way but still had success in his learning. [The argument if Sinai is better or uprooter of mountains would also seem to be relevant. The Gemara concludes that Sinai is better.] <???> <What do you mean by uprooter of mountains or sinai?> There are five books of Rabbi Nachman: three are his exact words, and two are the things Rabbi Nathan remembered that he said and wrote down. There are no other traditions from him contrary to what is commonly supposed.</p>
            <p>For instance, there is a commonly known saying which he said, that there would be no other Rebbi after him. However, when a Rav of Breslov died in Safed years ago, all the Breslovers made it a point to advertise throughout the Jewish community in New York that the Rav of Breslov had died for the publicity they would get from it. No Breslover then in Jerusalem, or New York, or Safed said anything about this supposed tradition. However, when only a few years later when Rav Shick started printing books that had his picture on them, and written underneath was, “The Leader of Breslov” [and Rav Shick was already very unpopular with the Breslover community for years] all of a sudden this tradition popped up.</p>
            <p>Now when did Rabbi Nachman say it? If before the guy from Safed died, why did nobody remember it then? Then it must be that it was after that guy died. But Rabbi Nachman himself passed away two hundred years ago. So it is obvious that Rabbi Nachman never said such a thing — and this is just another example of a very common phenomenon I have noticed in the Orthodox community, i.e., making up history to suit their political and financial needs.</p>
