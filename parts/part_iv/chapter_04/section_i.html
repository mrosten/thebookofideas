            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Time is in Kabbalah a ‘perfect form’ and has 613 parts, and an inner essence, and an outer essence. The faster one goes the closer he gets to the inner essence, and thus time slows down. (This is what Rabbi Nachman calls “the time becomes unified into one and the length becomes shorter — what Rabbi Nachman calls “The Place” becomes unified into one. Here, Rabbi Nachman predicts the existence of black-holes with a singularity inside). This means that time is like an electro-magnetic wave that flows through the time field. So, one year is four spiritual waves, the Rosh Hashanah wave starting and finishing on Rosh Hashanah. (But this is different in terms that its highest point is on Shavuot and lowest on Tisha BeAv), and at right angles to it is the month wave (starting in Nissan), and at a right angle to that is the week wave and then there is the day wave, so the whole thing is one big shear wave in 4 dimensions traveling through the time field like a gravitational wave in the space time field. Rabbi Nachman says the month wave used to start on Passover (i.e. like a cosine function where the origin is the highest point but now he says it originates on Purim.</p>
            <p>There are infinite levels that the Lekutai Moharan works on. The Lekutai Moharan was meant to be valid and consistent at every possible level as I heard once from some university professor on the way to Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashanah. Before that I had believed that every level in it was one specific level and my only question was how to verify which level it was speaking about. Now I believe that in each specific world the Lekutai Moharan has a specific level but it applies to each world differently. I also think that the books of the Baal HaTanya in general contain the hints necessary to decipher the intent of the Lekutai Moharan in Emanation.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Nachman predicts the fact that in a large gravitational field, time slows down, for by the Divine Presence where there is a large amount of energy he says the time becomes unified into a singularity. Rabbi Nachman said even on the left side there is a right and a left. This means that all spiritual systems are like a vertical totem pole with the wisdom on top but what determines a person's spirituality isn't the vertical level but the horizontal closeness to the vertical column (of the infinite light). For instance, lets say a person is Jewish — that puts him on a high rung of the ladder. But it doesn't have anything to do with whether he is good or evil.</p>
            <p>Only the horizontal closeness to [IMAGE: image052.gif] determines that. [i.e., only the x-coordinate determines good or evil. The y-coordinate determines the rung</p>
