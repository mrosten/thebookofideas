            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>Though Rabbi Nachman attacked the Guide to the Perplexed, there are many principles that he gets from there, like that “taking care of the body comes before taking care of the soul,” ( Guide III:27). Or the idea that prophecy is an extension of the power of imagination [the Guide II:38], the idea that prophecy is by an angel to all prophets except Moses [the Guide II:24]. Advice from Rabbi Nachman has to be taken with a grain of salt, i.e., what he would call Tzitzum. The mikvah may be able to sweeten judgements but what about the guy that was killed in Israel going to the mikvah and the child that died after his parent put him in the  freezing mikvah of the Ari. in Safed.Even if one has had seed come out of him at night, Rabbi Nachman said it is nothing unless it came also with sexual thoughts. The reason the mikvah no  longer works like it did for the Baal Shem Tov is that for him it was a time for  private prayer.</p>
            <p>Now that it is no longer private it is a waste of time unless in the case that Rabbi Nachman specifically said it for. All the advice of Rabbi Nachman has to be taken in this way--think: “Will this action increase my devakus in God ?” If the logical answer to that question is no then even if Rabbi Nachman said it is a good thing to do, he meant it for a different situation than the one that exists now for you. The only thing that he said one must do regardless of whether it increases his personal devakus or not is to be by him for every Rosh Hashanah Rabbi Nachman explains that in the higher Intelligence time goes slower and in that all the days of one’s life are instantaneous. The reason for this is that from the point of view of one who is moving at the speed of light all, events, future and past, appear simultaneously. Thus, the way to get attached to God, and included in that higher Intelligence, is by moving at the speed of light in spiritual terms. Of course, that is impossible for matter: therefore, one has to go into a closet and not be seen by himself or others, and then his wave function can be manifested, and he can become attached to God by attaching their thoughts to Him. However, since sin separates one from God as it says in the verse, “your sins were dividing between you and your God”, one needs go to</p>
