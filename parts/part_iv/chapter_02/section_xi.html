This quivering of the outer horizon produces ripples in space-time, gravitational waves, that spread both outward and inward. The ones that fall in are blue shifted. Since [IMAGE: image046.gif] , the inflow of blue shifted gravitational radiation that carries energy will produce an increase in the mass inside the black hole, increasing a core mass that starts out with just five times the mass of the sun going to 10 57 times the mass of the entire universe.</p>
            <p>This can't reach the outer universe, but at the big crunch when all the black holes merge, such intense gravitational fields are involved that the whole universe will collapse to the Plank scale. The rest of the collapse takes only 10 -43 seconds (Plank time). At that time the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of the black hole becomes meaningless and the total entropy is reduced drastically. At the same time, because there is no duration less than 10 -43 seconds (just like there is no distance shorter than 10 -33 centimeters), the collapsing universe 10 -43 seconds away from the singularity bounces back to become an expanding universe (since this doesn't defy entropy).</p>
            <p>This does away (almost) with the problem of the buildup of entropy from one cycle of an oscillating universe to the next. But there still is a small buildup of entropy from one cycle to the next. It seems possible that the origins of the</p>
