            <p>limit, like [IMAGE: image040.gif] . It is probably obvious to most scientists , but since I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere, I think it is proper to say this. The inverse square laws are a result of the fact that the surface area of the sphere is [IMAGE: image041.gif] , i.e., since the force coming out of any object is diluted over the area of a sphere the further out you go, gravity or the electromagnetic force must be reduced by a factor of r 2 . Every physical body has extension into imaginary space (not the fourth dimension, but into space times 'I'). This makes every mass, even if in a random chaotic shape, symmetrical. If you stop the vibrations at the nodes, you increase the frequency which increases the energy. This particularly should apply to the strings of which the atom is made. Also, to the galactic strings, so that at places where the galaxies don't form there should be an increase of energy.</p>
            <p>[Looking at this now I am not so sure for wasn't that the independent variable idea with the electron i.e., how someone wanted to explain the uncertainty of electron, and I seem to recall that was refuted experimentally. However, the imaginary numbers do seem to pop up in the most common places like electric current] The order of adding up the electrons to the chemical elements and the order of the unification table and the order of the table for proving the equivalence of the set of positive rational fractions with all natural numbers [Cantor's diagonal method] and the way of doing certain continuous integrals like <???> ò (x 3 )( e x ) is the same pattern of the parallel 45-degree lines through the table: [IMAGE: image042.jpg] The root of this is the fact that at the beginning before the correction the order of</p>
