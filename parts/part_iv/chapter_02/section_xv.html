            <h3>Section XV</h3>
            <p>st verse says they became Jewish because the fear of the Jews fell upon them, i.e. the fear of that which the Jews fear fell upon them, i.e. fear of the punishment of God. A later verse says they became Jewish because the fear of Mordechai fell upon them, i.e. that fear that Mordechai feared, i.e. fear and awe of the greatness of God. “The king of Sodom said to Abraham give me the soul and the money take for yourself”, i.e., the evil inclination offers one lots of money as long as he sells his soul.</p>
            <p>God said to Abraham go from your land from your birthplace and your father's house to the land I will show you, i.e., from the 3 dimensions of his world into the 4th dimension. Later, this actually occurred as the sages say on the verse, “and He took him outside,” i.e., out of the 3D of this world. (This idea is hinted to in one of Rabbi Nachman's stories.) The trait of Abraham is kindness. Therefore, his test was to see if he could be cruel in a case where God demanded it. The trait of Jacob is truth, therefore his test was to see if he could lie in the case where God demanded it. For Gods will is the definition of truth and kindness. — so, when God commands a cruel deed that deed is by definition kind. That is why the verse attributes kindness to Abraham, because he was willing to be cruel when God demanded it. So, when he was kind we know the kindness was real because it was connected to God. The same goes for Jacob.</p>
            <p>Abraham could be a Lamdan [dialectic Talmudic scholar] when he wanted to. He said, “She is my sister,” even though he had to stretch the truth beyond recognition to say so. But when God told him “Bring up Issac as a burn offering,” in which case he could have said it means bring up, i.e., put him on the alter and then take him down — which was in fact the final intention. But when it came to a commandment of God he didn't try to find a way out by using semantics. How did Esther know on the 2nd day to ask the King her request and not the 1 st ? Because on the 1st day he asked “What is your request, Esther,” but on the 2nd day he asked  “What is your request, Queen Esther?” On the 3 rd</p>
