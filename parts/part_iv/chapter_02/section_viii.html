            <p>concept in Kabbalah). (To the photons themselves time doesn't move, all space is one point, and its equivalent mass at that velocity is undefined.) (It's also well known that the 3 middle ones refer to the directions of space.) The first 100 elements are divided into the 10 sephirot of rulership of the physical universe e.g., hydrogen is rulership of rulership. Helium is the foundation of rulership. But after the correction helium is rulership of foundation, etc., and the order is vertical, not horizontal (as Rabbi Sar Shalom Sharabi explains in Nahar Shalom ) 7 rows of the periodic table correspond to the seven levels surrounding royalty, and the four orbitals (s, p, d, f) are the four letters of the Ineffable Name.</p>
            <p>The 10 sephirot of electro-magnetic radiation are: 1. Gamma rays. 2. X- rays. 3. Ultra-violet is the first three sephirot. 4. The visible spectrum is parallel to the 6 sephirot of Beauty (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange). Red, infrared and radio waves are Royalty. All these are the sephirot of the light while the elements are sephirot of the vessels. When we view the world from the Unification Table, we see that each particle can be reduced to some set of 5 binary numbers just like in any computer, and the state of the universe is given by the fields associated with these particles (as Frank Wilczek writes in Longing for the Harmonies ). This is because the 10 sephirot are really 5 (as Rabbi Chayim Vital explains at the end of the Eitz Chayim that there really are only 5 but they are known as 10 for the 6 th of Zeir Anpin are really just characteristics of Beauty -- not individual sephirot).</p>
            <p>And each universe consists of combinations of the 5 sephirot. So, the physical universe is an intricate “computer” program of the world of Formation on the “computer” of Creation, and so on.</p>
