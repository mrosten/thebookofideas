            <p>though we may not know what it is. The five Peano Axioms <sup>[12]</sup> capture the essence of natural numbers as the axioms of Euclid capture the essence of Plane Geometry. After one has them, he can theoretically build up by axioms and rules of logic the complete system. These axioms are the atoms of the system and correspond to the five partzufim [forms] of Crown, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter. The five axioms of Human behavior are the last five of the Ten Commandments. [This is in accordance with the Rambam's way of looking at the commandments as having their reality and essence in pure logic. According to him, the commandments have a reality separate from the fact that they are written in the Torah -- for even if they weren't we would have to obey them from reason. Thus, I am inclined to believe that these last five are axioms in the sense that transgressing them evokes a bad reaction on a person as a law of nature. Thus, even in cases where one thinks he has some permission from the Oral Law, I think one shouldn't depend on it.</p>
            <p>I think gravity is simply an inverse rubber band, i.e., matter pulls space-time out of shape. But instead of the distortion in shape pulling things apart it pushes them together. [I also think the electro-magnetic field is the same thing]. [IMAGE: image050.jpg] And God said, “let there be light and there was light.” That is the thread of his infinite light which shone into the darkness of the empty space. And God said, “Let there be a firmament,” which was the roof top of the empty space to divide between his infinite light, and the empty space.</p>
            <p>The waters above the empty space I don't know. The waters below are the space-time continuum. The seven days of creation are the seven circles of light before the straight light was created. The luminaries are wisdoms letting in God's infinite light, through the firmament into the empty space. The non-Jews at the time of Mordechai and Ester: The 1</p>
