            <h3>Section III</h3>
            <p>Many times, one is taught to find the Divine Will in the teachings of his rebbi or other saint or head of his yeshiva. Yet it is more in accordance with the Torah to find this guidance in the world at large. The universe is God's yeshiva. The real spiritual teachers are the people that really care about you, because they have the most intuitive understanding of your own soul. Being born in America, makes one’s nation [not people] America, however being Jewish makes one also part of the Jewish people. The fact is, no matter how Jewish one is, he partakes of the character of the country he was born in, and no matter how much he partakes of that character, inside he remains Jewish. This isn't the same as the difference between politics and religion which should remain separate. [UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T SINCE POLITICS HAS BECOME A RELIGION — Liberalism, Zionism, Religious Zionism, and Anti-Zionism are all religions now. I think it was better when religion was religion and politics was politics.] The problem with Orthodox Judaism today is that its ethics is based on an end, i.e., the advancement of itself, and that is very different than a morality based on the Divine Will [as per the first authorities] or on Reason [as per the Rambam]. The value of any end depends on its being set by Reason or the Divine Will and the advancement of Orthodox Judaism isn't an end stated or implied in the Torah. The Torah's morality is to do the mitzvot in order to get to be attached to God. [Since Orthodox ethics is end-based, this explains why in the mind of the orthodox it is permitted to lie, cheat, steal, kidnap and murder in order advance their movement, for to their way of thinking the advancement of their movement is all that matters. Only an ethics that is principle-based avoids these problems. However, Safardic Jewish ethics has been principle based until recently and thus their version of Torah ethics was much closer to the Torah. Also, Torah Ethics even with Ashkenazi Jewry was largely principal base in Russia and Poland. Only at the turn of the century did the socialist ideals floating around infected them and then it became a socialist movement and thus it remains until today.]</p>
