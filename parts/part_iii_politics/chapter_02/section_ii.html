            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>is the force of humanity, i.e., of being human. In theory this part of a person is totally ignored and all that is paid attention to is the Jewish part of a person. What is wrong with this - other than it being contrary to the Rambam - is that there is apparently a force of decency and compassion that if ignored or suppressed can be stamped out. Since I deal in this book with the Kabbalah , and the Kabbalah is clear that the only good part of any person is the Jewish part, I have to assume this force which I call the force of humanity, is in fact a Jewish force that has become adopted among the nations either by their own religions which have accepted Jewish principles or the exile of Jews among the nations, or the exile of the ten tribes “north”, i.e., into Europe apparently becoming the north European nations. At any rate, this force of humanity, I believe, is what the kabbalah calls yechida, the genius of the species.</p>
            <p>Chaya is the genius of the nation. The soul is the genius of the tribe, or state of the nation. Spirit is the genius of the family and the nefesh is the individual soul. Thus, the higher one rises spiritually the more he cares about others. Thus, the emphasis of the Torah on the Jewish people specifically only applied until the non-Jewish nations also began to gain the yechida , the genius of the species. For up till that time only the Jewish people embodied that genius. Thus, according to this way of thinking the inner spirit of humanity is what the Torah really means by Jewish.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why one must stick with one's family, since they are manifestations of one's spirit. Now the urge and longing for spirituality isn't from the soul, which is just a vessel for the Divine light, but rather from the Divine light itself. Thus, there is usually a tendency on the part of the soul to stick with his own family, friends, neighborhood, country -- while from the Divine light one wants to go off searching for something. As in all things one should find the middle path.</p>
