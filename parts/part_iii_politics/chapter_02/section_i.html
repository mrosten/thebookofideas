            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Movement Fear of freedom caused many people to go into Orthodox Judaism or other authoritarian cults. But by trust in God and confidence that God truly runs the world, one can face the future without fear. “One person can't touch what is meant for someone else”. However, it is important as one faces the world without the moral support of some vast group to feel a part of, that one sticks with his family and true friends. “Praise God all families of the Earth.” [I am not implying however that all authority is bad. There is rational authority and non-rational authority, i.e., authority that is intended for the growth and future self-sufficient independence of the subject is good authority. Authority which has in mind to keep the subject indefinitely dependent on the leader is evil.] There is a great crusade to indoctrinate non-religious college age people into the orthodox community. From many aspects this looks attractive except for one point. They themselves form an organic community. It is an entire network. When they have a strain in their marriage, they increase their interaction with friends and family and receive a large degree of support therefrom. The newcomers however are never really integrated into the community and therefore when they have a strain the community doesn't help and usually hurts considerably and since they broke their ties with their own families, they get no support from there either [of course there is some token help but nothing that really helps.</p>
            <p>And especially if they marry someone religious from birth or more integrated into the community than they will have to face an entire community effort to break up their marriage, and take their children and money as is already well known from common occurrences everyday.] There is a deep reason for this for everything below has its roots above, and the several non-orthodox movements within Judaism have their roots up above that are different than the orthodox. It's not that they are right. Those movements are wrong on many points. However, the non-religious Jews that belong to them come from a different spiritual root than the orthodox. In many ways that root is higher than that of the orthodox. And so, one who comes to join the Orthodox will not be accepted, not because of anything wrong with him or them but because they in fact have the innate intuition to realize what he doesn't realize; that he doesn't belong with them.</p>
            <p>One of the great problems I see today in Yiddishkeit is that it is an ethnic religion that tends to ignore a great force that is inside every person. That</p>
