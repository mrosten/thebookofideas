            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>“Nothing in America is so painful as the lack of joy. Pleasure is frantic and bacchanalian, a matter of momentary oblivion not of delighted self-expression. Men sit throughout the day glued to their desks, amid typewriters and telephone, serious, important and worthless.” -Bertrand Russell America is becoming increasingly totalitarian. This could spell the beginning of the end for it. I do believe however that there still is some hope for America. There needs to be a balance between secular and religious forces, because if either becomes the sole force we would have tyranny. And the worst thing would be if they worked together. The best thing is if they both remain sworn enemies of each other and hopefully that will leave an “empty space” in between for the decent people. We need to safeguard the things modern democracy and capitalism have accomplished in freedom for the individual. But we need to continue this process by an integration with the Bible.</p>
            <p>The reason America is becoming a police state is that freedom is being confused with the idea of protection of the rights of individuals. In a capitalistic free-flowing society, there are basic patterns of flow like in an ant colony where the free flow reinforces the caste system. When the government is perceived as the way for one group of people to get the money of another group, which they assume is their right, since they are the majority, the state becomes a police state. All people are born equal — this means born with the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor or intelligence. But it doesn't mean born with the right to someone else's money. But today that is exactly what Americans thinks. Therefore, America is doomed unless it goes back to its Christian roots. Yet the decay of a nation and its values can be the rebirth of something greater.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is the idea of a religious democracy, in place of the secular democracy. That is a democracy based on the majority rule, but with the Bible as its constitution [AS in fact John Locke envisioned in the first place.] Actually, the problem of America is, as Hegel saw, that when any society gets to the point of self-reflection it is at its peak and then must start the decay. Hegel didn't know the reason for this, but I think it is from Gödel theorem. The venerability of TNT is that it is capable of expressing statements about itself.</p>
            <p>Once America saw the contradiction of the Bible and the principles of democracy it felt it had to go in one direction or the other. But they didn't know that the whole strength of America depended on that contradiction, not on one or the other or both but the contradiction itself. [Perhaps this is the reason Rome fell, they became totally religious, instead of the necessary combination of</p>
