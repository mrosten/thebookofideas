            <h2>Chapter 3: The Usa</h2>
            <h3>Section IV</h3>
            <p>We have come to the time Bertrand Russell feared, “When science has become venerable, it will control our lives as much as religion has ever. I foresee the time when all who care for the freedom of the human spirit will have to rebel against a scientific tyranny.” - Marriage And Morals , Bertrand Russell. However, this is to be taken in context. There are many standard procedures in medicine and valid approaches in psychology. These should be used. The same Rabbi Nachman who despised doctors, when the first vaccine came out, said “you have to take your children even in the middle of the winter to the village where they are giving the vaccine.” – The appendix of the Book of 13 stories.</p>
            <p>The general practice of Breslovers is to get three doctors opinions before any major procedure. The criticism here is on the character of psychologists and therefore automatically on their effectiveness. John Adams wrote in his diary on his trip to New York to convince them to sign the Constitution, “I can't understand why everybody in New York is so nasty.” (This was when it's total population was only about 10,000). There is an extraordinary spirit of greed and anger in New York. It isn't reactionary anger, but anger which is ever present and only waiting for an opportunity to surface.</p>
            <p>The freedom of the media to enter a court room is the only thing to check the power of judges in the USA. [In Hegel's ideal state also the court proceedings had to be public.] I find it fascinating that everyone is worried about the moral issue of cloning. Already it is banned in Europe and America (even before it exists). Angry letters into the newspapers about scientists involved in cloning. Yet not a peep about abortion. I can only conclude that, in the western mentality, to destroy life is moral but to create life is immoral.</p>
            <p>No wonder this last century has been so bloody. In the 1960's the goal in life of the majority of youth was to find a true life philosophy. Today it's to have money. We are digressing backwards. War can't be too far away. The dislike today of the scientists means that the connection between rulership and wisdom is gone and therefore rulership has fallen into stupidity and when that happens things tend to decay into chaos rapidly.</p>
