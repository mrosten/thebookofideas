            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>general good. The root of their disagreement is in the worlds of tohu and tikun [chaos and correction]. A synthesis of their idea would be to bring the vessels of correction and the light of chaos together so that individual rights can be contained in the outside order.  However individual rights or public good have absolutely no weight in Torah thought, whether the written or Oral Law. You may find some hint here or there, but these are not Torah ideas. The Torah has only one idea: Serve God and keep his laws and if you serve other gods then woe is to you. However, implicit in Torah thought is the idea that you cannot add to the laws which implies that no man can impose further restrictions than what is already given once in the Torah, and which will never change The system of the Torah is not centralized system. The Sanhedrin at the time was only to decide cases of law where the litigants came to them. The king was to guard the borders and fight the wars. The kings of Israel were heads of the army, not judges to teach, lay down or enforce the law. Just like today the president is the head of the armed forces (the limits to the power of a King are a subject of debate in the Gemarah ). [To one opinion in the Gemara there is no commandment to have a King at all. The Torah only says, “when you will ask for a King.” It doesn't say you should do so.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Meir from Rotenburg the rabbi (teacher) of the Rosh said, “No law could apply to a community unless the community accepted it first.” The Talmud says, God told Moses that one can't appoint a leader over a community unless one first asks the community. That was a case where God and Moses both knew the right person. Thus, we find some idea of democracy in the Talmud (even though the idea was that what the people thought mattered but that they wouldn't accept the leader even if God said to unless they were asked first). But I must point out the Sanhedrin wasn't voted on. They received semichah from a rebbi who received it before them, who received it before them, etc., until Moses. (Today there is no semichah</p>
