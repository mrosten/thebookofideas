            <h3>Section I</h3>
            <p>Torah “Without true virtue, God is just a word.” [Plotinus II:9] “They make merchandise out of you.” [Peter II] Because some people believe their purpose in life is to have pleasure, the Torah wanted to take the major body of the Torah government out of their hands, [the judicial branch the local, the circuit and supreme courts, and the police] and put it into the hands of the intellectuals [Aristotle's politically minded people], that is people that had semicha [rabbi from rabbi up to Moses] so that in no way could the whims of the general people decide who should be a rabbi. This, of course, is no guarantee, since people always get the government, they deserve, and the intellectuals aren't going to be all that much better or worse than the regular populace.</p>
            <p>However, a little bit better it does remain. The way, however, that it ensures that the rabbis don't become a self-serving bureaucracy is by the ability of the people to choose the king who is in control of the military. The reason why the Torah does give some power to the people even though they see pleasure as being the purpose of their lives is that pleasure is a guide to correct conduct. It isn't a goal, but it is a guide to the actions that God considers correct. But it only comes into the category of good if it is done for the sake of God.</p>
            <p>Politics and religion are closely related, for we find that before the Edict of Toleration, only 10% of Romans were Christian, but within a few years after that, the vast majority became Christian. This is one reason why rabbis and priests guard their power so closely - it really is for the sake of God- to keep people religious. But the externalization of religion is the death of inner religion and piety so the Torah limits the laws that can be imposed on people and essentially takes religion out of the hands of man and sets up the rabbis only to clarify points of the law about which some doubt arises and judges and police to enforce the law. In essence the Torah is the constitution, and the Sanhedrin is to interpret the Torah but not to change it.</p>
