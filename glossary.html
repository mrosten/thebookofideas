Complete means every fundamental sequence has a limit.It is like having an outside hull. A linear space is called normed if  for every element there is associated a real number [a distance more than or equal to zero] and it has these basic qualities [IMAGE: image057.gif] ||only if [IMAGE: image058.gif] , [IMAGE: image059.gif] , even if a is complex: [IMAGE: image060.gif] The bars mean the distance.</dd>

        <dt id="cantors-diagonal-argument--take-the">Cantors diagonal argument. Take the</dt>
        <dd>list of all the real numbers between 0 and 1. Go down the diagonal and change every digit by one. Put a decimal place in front of the number you get. Now, this number is different than the first one because it has a different first digit. It is different than the second because it has a different second digit,... So you found a real number between 0 and 1 not on the list of all real numbers between 0 and 1!!! Chasidishe.</dd>

        <dd>space In mathematics, Hilbert spaces (named after David Hilbert) allow generalizing the methods of linear algebra and calculus from (finite-dimensional) Euclidean vector spaces to spaces that may be infinite-dimensional. Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics, typically as function spaces. Formally, a Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with an inner product that defines a distance function for which the space is a complete metric space. — Wikipedia Kabbalah The esoteric literature of the Torah.</dd>

        <dd>would be empty of his Infinite light so that there would be a place for creation.

        <dd>circular sephirot were created. Then He drew the light of the name 45 into the empty space and it came down and became in the form of a person.

        <dd>this is the fourth of such cycles. If you add to that the other opinion of rabbi Issac of Akko the each day of these cycles is a day of God which is 1000 of our years you get the age of the world to be about ten billion years.</dd>

        <dd>explain dinosaurs. But Breslovers think Rabbi Nachman didn't hold from this, but I think Rabbi Nachman was objecting to another shemita opinion that each 450 years in our time represents a different sepherah which the Baal Hatanya held from, but not the Reshash, for he divides the years into cycles of 10, so to him each 100 years is a complete cycle, however the Rabbi Chayim Ben Atar seems to have held from the seven seven option since he divides a persons life into cycles of seven years seven years etc.</dd>

        <dd>if we add a sixth axiom to TNT, i.e., that it is not true that for all “a” (0+a) = a. It turns out with this that we have one axiom that says all natural numbers have a certain property and another which says there are numbers which do have it. Thus we have a number/s that if you add a zero to them come out different.</dd>
